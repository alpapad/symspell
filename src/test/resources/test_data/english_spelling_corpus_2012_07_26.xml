The card offered me one to three years of no interest (<mw correct="dependent" type="subphon" mv="no">dependant</mw> on the total cost), as long as I continued to make payments. With everything I bought, I ended up with three years of no interest. What I ended up doing was calculating my payments so that I could pay it off in half the time (1.5 years). This gave me enough time to pay it without having to worry about hitting the three years. If I had an emergency during one month, I could pay less and continue my payments the following month. During tax return seasons, I usually paid a bit more to get it paid off even sooner.</s>
		<s sv="no">I know posts have been rather thin recently.  Several things have kept life busy combied with viruses in the computer I normally use and wanting to practice as well as take care of family business.  All this is to say, when the ladder of importance is examined to decide where time costly activities are listed, blogging is on the low end of the list and will be dropped.  I still like to read and surf a bit when able, but note that writing does take up a bit more time and energy which I have been using other places.  The other thing is probably because this idea has been churning in my head for a while and I don‚Äôt like the feeling of writing it.  I believe it is applicable, and that‚Äôs probably the real problem.  When writing on national issues, I am a hospice nurse charting the slow demise of the individual with a known end.  Paying attention to these issues puts me in that position.  I am old enough to remember getting cookies, popcorn balls, and apples from neighbors for halloween.  I remember the change when it was broadcast across the news how a kid was cut by a razorblade in an apple.  The rise of socialism was the destruction of safety and loss of social cooperation.  There is a commercial that irritates me ‚Äì the mom has a stressful moment as she has not seen her kid for about 10 sec.  Since when was that stressful?  Only if there is no trust of your fellow citizens.  The advancement of the ‚Äúmelting pot‚Äù which I had in elementary gave way to the ‚Äúmulticulturalism‚Äù which is used to divide people since.  The rule of law no longer applies in this nation.  I have stated this before, and it bears repeating because there is a desire to remenisce things from childhood and that country no longer exists.  We have an elected official who admits in court via his lawyers that his birth certificate presented to the nation is a fake.  Fraud. Illegimate.  And this official continues to run for an additional term in office and no one has raised an eyebrow to say, ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù  A law gets passed mandating everyone bow to the feds regarding health insurance.  1700 exemptions have been given so far.  If it‚Äôs a law, it theoretically should apply to everyone.  The fact it doesn‚Äôt illustrates that fact this was simply a means of extortion.  Yes, extortion.  The company that kisses the ring and receives an exemption has a much lower cost of business than their competition.  The family farms from whom the pigs are being destroyed about whom Ted Nugent speaks.  Is there anything allowing the government to go on private property and destroy an individual‚Äôs private property without compensation or recourse?  I think that was covered in a certain <mw correct="amendment" type="insrep" mv="no">ammendment</mw>.  We can now have all of our transactions monitored by the government with anticipated use against us without a court of law.  That was the law passed at the end of last year combined with the one just pushed through over objections and payola to the internet companies.  Those two absolutely ignore the bill of rights and make it possible for the federal government to monitor private communications, decide they are not up to snuff, and put someone into prison for life without charges or chance to appeal to the judiciary.  Speaking of the judiciary, our arbitors of common sense and truth, since when can a highest ranking judge use and properly administer the tenants of a document which she openly maligns in another country.  In a sane, properly administered system, that would be grounds for impeachment.</s>

		<s sv="no">What‚Äôs the #1 tourist attraction in the entire Florida Keys? By far it‚Äôs the incredible 7-Mile Bridge! But wait‚Ä¶ believe it or not there‚Äôs two 7-Mile Bridges! For those of you not from the Keys or have never traveled here you might not know that. This blog will highlight the older first and original 7-Mile Bridge that was used until 1982.¬†It connected Knight‚Äôs Key in the Middle Keys to Little Duck Key in the Lower Keys. It was one of the longest bridges in the world¬†when it was built and yet only¬†one of the many spectacular bridges on US-1 in the Florida Keys.¬†Get this,¬†the original name for the bridge was ‚ÄúKnights Key-Pigeon Key-Moser Channel-Pacet¬†Channel Bridge‚Äù‚Ä¶ wow, was that a mouth full with many thanks to those <mw correct="responsible" type="subphon" mv="no">responsable</mw> who changed it to the ‚ÄúSeven Mile Bridge‚Äù. It¬†was constructed from 1909-1912 under the direction of Henry Flagler as part of the Florida East Coast Railway‚Äôs Key West Extension known as the Overseas Railroad. This bridge was badly damaged by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, and subsequently refurbished by the U.S. Government as an automobile highway bridge. Look closely and you‚Äôll see that the guard rails are made out of the former railway tracks! (too cool) If you ask what‚Äôs that black pipe in the photo to the left, it was the freshwater lifeline to the Keys for many years. It had a swing span that opened to allow passage of boat traffic near¬†Pigeon Key, a small island where a work camp for Flagler‚Äôs railroad was located. The vast majority of the original bridge¬†still exists, used as fishing piers and access to Pigeon Key minus the swing span noticeably missing as one of the two voids you‚Äôll see. This is a very narrow bridge contributing to its demise. In fact, I remember as a child traveling in our Chevy Chase Griswold Family Vacation type station wagon and having to fold the cars side mirrors in so that the opposing traffic wouldn‚Äôt hit it‚Ä¶ which happened way to often believe me! Today it‚Äôs relegated to foot &amp; bicycle¬†traffic not even being able to support the former tourist tram that traveled it for years.

		<s sv="no">Being that the players are in shells today it is very hard to take much of anything from practice today for the running back group. However, both Chris Polk (Washington) and Doug Martin (Boise State) showed nice burst and acceleration from the little I was able to see of them today. Surely this will be a solid battle as well this week as I have both rated pretty closely and their performance this week will go¬†a long way in separating themselves from one another in the minds of talent evaluators. Both players came in very strong with Martin showing up at a strong 5-9 219 lbs., while Polk came in at a sturdy 5-10 224 lbs. Both have the look of potential feature backs in the NFL with the capability to produce for whichever team chooses to draft them. Issiah Pead (<mw correct="Cincinnati" type="delrep,insrep" mv="no">Cincinatti</mw>) however did not look the part and I was disappointed to see him weigh in at a slight¬†5-9 193 lbs.

		<s sv="no">The biggest winner from this group today had to be T.J. Graham (NC State) who showed plus burst and suddenness in and out of his breaks to create separation consistently. His hands were also very good as I did not see him drop a pass today. Graham is one of the faster players in this game¬†and could time as well as 4.3 in¬†next month‚Äôs NFL Combine. It will be¬†interesting to see whether¬†Graham¬†has just¬†track speed or if he is really¬†a complete football¬†player, as he certainly looked like the former in today‚Äôs practice. Graham has built some solid momentum going into Tuesday. One player who I had highlighted as a potential small school sleeper was Appalachian State‚Äôs Brian Quick. Quick had at least 3 drops on the day and seemed a tad bit intimidated by the big stage. His routes were sloppy and he really showed little burst and acceleration in and out of his cuts.¬†Quick tended to round off his routes and was not nearly as crisp as you would like to see as he had trouble dropping his weight to generate momentum into his breaks. Today was a disappointing practice for the small school star but it will be interesting to see how he responds to what was a <mw correct="lacklustre" type="trans" mv="no">lackluster</mw> and disappointing day overall. I didn‚Äôt get a very good look at the rest of the wide receiver‚Äôs but Cal‚Äôs Marvin Jones is one player who was said to have a pretty good day as he beat Dennard on a vertical¬†route in one on ones. Ohio State‚Äôs Devier Posey¬†had an okay practice as he showed nice route running¬†skills in 1 on 1‚Ä≤s but¬†struggled hauling and looking in passes from what I was able to gather.</s>
		<s sv="no">One player who received a late invite is a player I have hyped up quite a bit early on¬†in the scouting process. Cincinnati‚Äôs Derek Wolfe was a menace today showcasing great pass rush moves, as his relentless motor was evident to everyone in attendance. He certainly looked like he had something to prove as he consistently plays with solid leverage and pad level. Wolfe is a player I think will be one of the biggest risers from this week when it‚Äôs all said and done and I¬†am excited to see more from him during the week. A player who <mw correct="disappointed" type="delrep,insrep" mv="no">dissapointed</mw> today was Washington‚Äôs DT¬†Alameda Ta‚Äôamu who struggled to create¬†any sort of pass rush in individual drills.

		<s sv="no">The big loser of the day seemed to be Nebraska‚Äôs Alfonzo Dennard who struggled transitioning from his back pedal to running with receivers downfield. This is a concern because some had already questioned Dennard‚Äôs ability to turn his hips smoothly and run with receivers as he was¬†burned by Marvin McNutt, who doesn‚Äôt possess too much straight line speed himself. Dennard looks more comfortable up at the line in press coverage and will surely have to be protected by over the top coverage, where he has a safety to pass his man along to. Dennard also looks much more comfortable when the play is in front of him, as he shows nice ability to click and close on his target. Dennard is a player that doesn‚Äôt fit all schemes but he is still an extremely efficient player who excels in other categories‚Ä¶ it just so happened that today‚Äôs drill work exposed many of the main¬†weaknesses Denard possesses as a prospect. I am expecting a better showing in the coming days and think he will do much better in the game on Saturday where the coach‚Äôs will play to his strengths and allow him to play in a scheme his is most comfortable in. None of the other corners were too impressive, especially Boston College‚Äôs Donnie Fletcher who got high in his back pedal and showed a lot of tightness in his hips as well.

		<s sv="no">So Game of Death II isn‚Äôt actually a proper Bruce Lee movie. The filmmakers might say it was done as tribute to him but the majority think it was more of a shameless cash-in on his name. The Bruce Lee footage on show here is leftover material taken from his other movies and 2 doubles (Yuen Biao for the acrobatic fights and Kim Tai Chung for the rest) takes his place in the new footage shot. So I would advise viewers to forget about this being a Bruce Lee movie. To be perfectly honest, once the footage of Bruce has finished and his character Billy Lo dies from a dart to the neck, the movie actually gets better and is actually a very good martial arts movie although the plot is barely passable. For those who just want to see the martial arts that won‚Äôt really matter. This movie is in fact better than the first Game Of Death which was a bit of a mess.

With Yuen Wo Ping as the fight choreographer you know you‚Äôre gonna get some great stuff and this is true in this movie especially during the climax as Bobby makes his way into the underground Tower Of Death which looks more like a villain‚Äôs lair from a James Bond movie and has to fight the various opponents on offer there.¬† Kim Tai Chung does OK as Bobby Lo.

		<s sv="no">A big theme of this blog is Life as Retreat. The main idea is that if you have a mind of retreat, your normal life is transformed into your retreat. You view everything as emanated by your spiritual guide as part of your retreat. He emanates different things for you to learn and practice different things. Everything that happens to you, you view as part of your long retreat. In this modern time, people do not have the time or conditions to engage in traditional retreat, so learning how to transform our normal lives into our spiritual retreat enables the people of this modern age to fulfill their worldly obligations to work and family and engage in lifelong retreat without having to sacrifice one for the other.

But it seems when I started this blog, I did not realize all the different ways in which my life would change. Since I just started at the State Department, my life is going to be quite different. I am at the cusp of a completely new life. If all goes as it appears now (which means it probably won‚Äôt‚Ä¶), I will likely spend the next 20-27 years working for the State Department, travelling to many different countries, doing many different things, meeting many different people and gradually gaining higher and higher levels of <mw correct="responsibility" type="del" mv="no">responsiblity</mw>.

I went to CDL which gave me teaching experience which enabled me to get the job at UNT which then enabled me to get the job at the State Department. This has been Dorje Shugden‚Äôs plan all along. The landslide, the new management taking over at CDL, the change of the tuition policy, having to leave, coming to Dallas, having the twins (I would not have applied when I did had we not had the twins), having the time necessary to properly study and prepare for the written exam (Simone being here) and the oral exam (the twins being hospitalized and Claudine leaving for Spokane), everything has all been gradually creating the conditions for me to be able to embark on this new life. Stupidly and ignorantly we have been resisting the whole way. We have been stressing, worrying, fighting the whole way. This is just my lack of faith that Dorje Shugden has taken over my life (because I freely gave it to him a long time ago) and that everything he arranges is for the best, even if we do not realize how and why at the time.</s>

		<s sv="no">Here‚Äôs a brief synopsis and response to the above video: ¬†This one‚Äôs got it all. ¬†From pineal gland activation to growing your own food and Conan O‚ÄôBrian. ¬†I personally love seeing a video such as this, for it encapsulates so much of the research I have found in scattered corners of the web and synthesizes it into about 19 minutes of positive vibratory knowledge. ¬†As for my comments, I have to say, that tidbit about the three littler lemonaders was quite¬†astonishing. ¬†Three little girls can‚Äôt sell lemonade without a business license? ¬†Please, give me a god damn break! ¬†Our laws, originally intended to protect freedom, are now robbing us of freedom. ¬†Remember, we must not ‚Äúfight back‚Äù in an ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù attempt to restore order through anarchy. ¬†You must accept the change with peace and tranquility in your heart. ¬†What is particularly interesting about this little ‚Äúarrest‚Äù is that just ten short days ago, our president, Barrack Obama, signed an executive order into law which was some interesting provisions (see link below). ¬†Although the bill applies to energy, technology, and production, there is a large portion of this bill which pertains directly to food. ¬†With a population growing s rapidly, the ¬†food economy is becoming increasingly hard to handle. ¬†And, this isn‚Äôt because we can‚Äôt support that kind of population, it is because the current system of food production needs to be revamped. ¬†More people should eat less, more people should begin a sungazing practice, and more people should grow their own food. ¬†Those three steps could do wonders for our world. ¬†Now, this video calls food additives and quality into question. ¬†It says that the government¬†purposefully¬†poisons our food to manipulate our pineal gland. ¬†This may seem like a stretch to some, but I wholly agree with this notion. ¬†I talked a lot in my previous post about the strength of DMT. ¬†Many people report that a DMT experience (whether self-propagated¬†or synthetic) increases intellect, executive control, and openness of mind. ¬†It is used freely among South American Shamans. ¬†In the Land of the Free, that substance is illegal and could lead to your imprisonment, the ultimate theft of your natural rights. ¬†Not to mention the fact that TV, according to the video, also harms the brain. ¬† There is no doubt that the media is controlled by the powers that be. ¬†Now, evidence shows that the food industry is, too. ¬†And, as the video says, these powers are negative beings. ¬†They are ego-absorbed and want to harm you. ¬†Free yourself! ¬†So, to put poisonous additives in food is not a stretch. ¬†Truly, there can abolutely zero speculation on the point that there are such poisons in our products. ¬†Flouride = rat poison. ¬†You brush your teeth with rat poison (unless you have already purchased one of the many excellent <mw correct="fluoride" type="trans" mv="no">flouride</mw> free brands!). ¬†That is all I have to say for now; I‚Äôm outta juice..</s>

There was another girl who I got a moment or so to speak with but not to any great length.

He has been appointed with the view that any chance of progression through a difficult group stage in Ukraine this summer will be a success for a team that is under the immense confusion where no permanent captain is in place, two of its main stars are out injured and suspended for the first two matches while the first-choice central-defensive pairing are split by a row over alleged racism. Hodgson‚Äôs penchant for a stable environment will be seen as the quick-fire solution to¬†any fire that threatens to encapsulate England¬†and whilst he would be criticised for airing a view that the Quarter-Finals would be a success here, it is the realistic aim of the nation. A four year deal is in place for a progression after this summer in which Hodgson can aid the development of the technical unit at the new footballing centre at Burton, as well as overseeing his priorities on the pitch where results at West Brom and at Fulham, where he <mw correct="achieved" type="trans" mv="no">acheived</mw> two mid-table finishes (seventh and twelfth) and a UEFA cup final spot after saving the club from relegation¬†in his first half-year at the club, suggest he is capable of doing.</s>

The exhaust collector could be seen to duct towards a double thickness section of floor ahead of the rear wheels.

We love power and authority, and all the ‚Äúperks‚Äù we assign to them, not really grasping that there is no true authority without commensurate responsibility, and forgetting the ultimate example of Jesus Christ Himself.

This point is very important, and it caused Jesus to praise the faith of the Roman centurion who recognized it.

		<s sv="no">The Tudors ‚Äì chances are you‚Äôve heard of them or at least their most famous member ‚Äì King Henry VIII. Henry VIII rather than¬†being remembered for being a strong ruler and his ability to command the attention of a country,¬†is remembered for his romantic habits. It‚Äôs those habits which led to 6 marriages and a series of dead wives. He only actually had 2 (maybe 3) or his wives killed, 1 died in childbirth, 1 he couldn‚Äôt stand being married to, and 1 survived.¬†His first wife was Catherine of Aragon, the former wife of his own brother (who died approximately 1 year after marriage). Their marriage was long and prosperous, but provided Henry with but one child, a girl, Mary. Now here lies the problem, traditionally royal lineages, and all lineages are followed through a son. Catherine had long since passed¬† age for children, and had not provided him with a son. Henry then fell in love with a young girl, Anne Boleyn¬†(who you‚Äôve also probably heard of, there was recently a movie released about her). Anne Boleyn¬†refused to settle for being the King‚Äôs mistress, instead she aimed to be queen. By refusing to bed the King, she ultimately led the religious rebellion which permitted Henry to divorce Catherine and marry Anne. Their marriage was short-lived and full of hate, but Anne provided Henry with another child, Elizabeth, a girl. Henry‚Äôs displeasure with Anne led to an accusation of adultery and her death. Henry then married his current mistress Jane Seymore. Finally this union resulted in the birth of a son, Edward VI. But the happiness was short-lived when Jane died from complications from childbirth. Henry then set about continuing his lineage and arranged a¬†strategic marriage with Anne of Cleaves. However, upon meeting her he discovered that she was horribly ugly and refused to remain married to her. Their marriage was annulled and Anne of Cleaves lived, and was <mw correct="referred" type="delrep" mv="no">refered</mw> to as the King‚Äôs Beloved Sister, and outlived all the other wives. Following Anne, Henry married yet again for ‚Äòlove‚Äô to Catherine Howard.

Both Gardiner and his regiment seem to have been in poor  spirits at this time. He fought at the battle of Prestonpans (21  September 1745) close to his own house, Bankton in Haddingtonshire.  Gardiner‚Äôs soldiers mostly fled but, though shot and wounded, he  dismounted to fight on foot to encourage the infantry. He was eventually  disabled by a blow from a lochaber-axe, and died at Tranent manse the  following morning, 22 September. On 24 September Gardiner was buried in  the churchyard at Tranent, where he had been a regular <mw correct="worshiper" type="insrep" mv="no">worshipper</mw>. He  was survived by his wife.</s>

So we‚Äôll start with that. It‚Äôs pretty. Tateo Retsu is a very skilled illustrator who makes everyone look perfect. There‚Äôs not a single flaw in his art style, really. Now, the story. It‚Äôs very amusing, but because is was copied word for word from the novel, I can‚Äôt say much about it except that the novel is well written. Sousuke‚Äôs dumbfounded adventures in the regular school life of an average teenager is really funny. And there‚Äôs also a good amount of giant robot action and suspense. And the relationship between Sousuke and Chidori is interesting to watch, as it develops as the manga progresses. This is definitely a manga that I <mw correct="recommend" type="insrep,delrep" mv="no">reccomend</mw> reading, if not for the art. The novel deserves your attention as well.</s>

McDonalds is currently trading at 17x FY2012 EPS estimates and Coke is trading at 19x FY2012 EPS estimates. They are both only growing earnings at 10% annually and pay dividends of less than 3%. Go figure. On the other hand, companies growing much faster such as AAPL and GOOG are much cheaper. AAPL is trading at less than 13x the consensus estimates for their FY ending on 9/30/2012 and GOOG is currently trading at only 14x their FY2012 estimates. This makes no sense to me at all. I can understand why people may be a bit skeptical of AAPL‚Äôs ability to continue their torrid growth rates considering that 51% of all American households now have at least one AAPL product under their roof but for the life of me I can‚Äôt figure out why mature companies like KO and MCD are trading at P/E‚Äôs of 17-19.</s>

		<s sv="no">The other day, we were working with a candidate in his search for employment. He is a senior level manager who was recently laid off after many years with the same firm. He came to us because his job search was proving to be unsuccessful. We‚Äôve now had a relationship with this candidate for more than a year. The initial meetings we had with him were spent on re-working his resume and discussing job search strategies. After being employed for so long with the same firm, he‚Äôd had no reason to work on his resume (and it showed). It needed a lot of work! After a few months, we found him a contract opportunity for about 6 months. It was a step back in pay and the level of responsibility he is accustomed to, but it was an opportunity to work; and an opportunity to get his foot in the door of a very large corporation. The contract ended after 6 months due to budgetary constraints and the employer was not able to extend the contract or offer him a permanent position. About a month after his contract ended, the employer came back to us to see if the candidate was still available and if he‚Äôd be interested in coming back for a few more weeks. When we spoke with the candidate to ask him if he‚Äôd be interested in going back for a few more weeks, he‚Äôd responded, ‚ÄúNo. That work was beneath me and the pay was an <mw correct="embarrassment" type="delrep" mv="no">embarrasment</mw>.‚Äù We asked the candidate if he had managed to find work on his own, to which he responded, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He was still unemployed and actively looking for work, but he wasn‚Äôt willing to go back to a, ‚Äúmenial job for crap pay.‚Äù We promptly informed our client that he was no longer available for that position because he felt he was being underutilized and wasn‚Äôt interested interested in returning. Our take is this: There is no shame in work. In this incredibly competitive job search environment, it‚Äôs better to be working, than not. And you never know what doors will open when you start any new job. While others might disagree with our opinion on this matter, we think it says a lot about a person‚Äôs character when they express things like, ‚ÄúThat job is beneath me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be unemployed and remain on Employment Insurance rather than do that job.‚Äù Let‚Äôs put it this way: You cannot put ‚ÄúEmployment Insurance‚Äù on your resume. It adds no value to your experience, but it does say a lot about your character. Going back to the candidate, while we still do maintain a relationship with him, we have to admit that we don‚Äôt feel the same level of commitment in assisting him in his job search than we did about a year ago. Being human, we simply don‚Äôt feel the same level of confidence in representing him to potential clients. It may not be fair, but it‚Äôs the reality.</s>

What is the purpose of this blog is the question.  Over the course of this last year I have been exposed to some amazing people and have made personal development an important focus of my life.  Being successful, not by the world's standards, but by God's has become my main focus.  Mainly, I want to work to develop myself as a person who is kinder, reaches out to help those in need, and truly makes a difference in this world.

As I am reading and experiencing things that are truly amazing and life changing, I will be posting them on this blog.  Obviously, I will not be able to post everything in it's entirity, but I will be summarizing them and letting you know the source of the article or book they come from so you can check them out later if you wish.  I want this blog to be a place where you can go to often and be inspired and leave here with a smile on your face. I will be covering all kinds of different topics dealing with success and personal development.  Topics like taking action, relationships, living to your potential, reinventing yourself, finances, leadership, presenting, goal setting, time management, etc.  I will also be occasionally including topics on cooking, music, and gardening because they are special interests of mine.

And what the money changers would do is cheat the poor who came in to exchange their money.

But now imagine if they gave you $30 Canadian instead. That‚Äôs what the money lenders would do. In one sense, they‚Äôre far more brazen about their greed than we are.

Fish Hoek is a little village about half an hours drive from the City Centre, with a wonderful beach. I was out taking some shots in the early morning, when I noticed some activity on the shore near where I was walking. Curiosity got hold of me, and I decided to walk closer and have a look. There were a whole lot of people in the water around what appeared to be a fishing boat. The boat had these timber beams tied to the boat and sticking out on both sides. As the boat got closer to shore a bunch of men from the group of people moved to both sides of the boat, each taking up a <mw correct="position" type="del" mv="no">postion</mw> at one of the beams sticking out of the side of the boat.

		<s sv="no">Most accurately, however, the draft is presented by the league as a celebration of its supreme influence over the world of sports and a testament to its overwhelming impact in American culture. Even with the present day‚Äôs 24-hour news cycle, the NFL consistently manages to dominate sports coverage throughout the week of the draft, even despite the fact that an actual game has not been played since the previous winter‚Äôs Super Bowl, despite playoff basketball and hockey, and despite the advent of what is supposed to be America‚Äôs favorite <mw correct="pastime" type="insrep" mv="no">pasttime</mw>‚Äôs regular season, draft week coverage consumes sports headlines. What‚Äôs more, the same monotonous batch of exhausted storylines about the draft that have already been examined and analyzed inside and out for likely several weeks or months prior, and yet they are still trumpeted among sports personalities with the same urgency of a presidential election. Regardless, fans still pack Radio City, millions still watch the live television broadcast, and the same so-called draft experts become almost permanent fixtures in sports programming for more than 72 hours, and the league wouldn‚Äôt want to have it any other way. Since the inaugural draft in 1935, the National Football League has made aggressive strides throughout the years to popularize the event, primarily by appeasing the media. The NFL‚Äôs consistent advances in the level of access to the draft each year has proven mutually beneficial for both itself and its devoted collection of talking heads, microphones, and cameras. ESPN was the first outlet to capitalize on the league‚Äôs willingness to make the collegiate draft available when it broadcast the first several rounds during the first few years of the network‚Äôs infancy in the early 1980‚Ä≤s. Already revolutionizing what had been an informal conference call in the years predating the public interest, the NFL has handsomely reaped the fruits of the public‚Äôs constantly increasing appetite for the draft, culminating with this, the 2012 National Football League Draft and its current format. The first round is broadcast in primetime following day-long coverage on ESPN, and this year featured the introduction of a heavier presence of sideline reporters interviewing the potential draftees as they leave their stretch limos to walk a red carpet, pose for pictures, and discuss the suits they are wearing in an eerily similar vein as the spotlight on various dresses seen on the red carpet prior to an Oscars ceremony. Several of ESPN‚Äôs own broadcasters joked about the unprecedented fervor surrounding the event in making light of the relative scarcity of actual discussion pertaining to football itself, only further affirming the role the draft has come to assume as more than a gimmick or phenomenon, but rather a justifiable institution in the sports landscape, and one that only looks to continue its upward surge in popularity and importance.</s>

		<s sv="no">Duchamp painted a wonderful window into the chess realm of Sophia Venus and as he did so she shed further her garments in her escape from the feudal halls of time, through the various window lattices and portols, which had been unclocked by the master key maker. Here is one called the Portrait  de joueurs d‚Äô√©checs 1911, where we see the multiple trails of a dual androgynous union of conjugal blessedness shining through, high up on one level congealing as a chess game unifies in the cerebal heights, and down below the taking form as the child of the union of the opposites, but there are various alternatives and angles <mw correct="receding" type="insrep,phon" mv="no">receeding</mw> towards and away from that and figures looking each and everyway despite the perception of centrality.

		<s sv="no">Chess is somewhat tied up in this too, as in its thought processes of what one asumes to be real line of play, represented perfectly in one‚Äôs chess thinking nodes of thought and sequencing memories, is not actually what it is claimed to be in reality, even though one assumes it be a real and good line of play, it proves out later to have been a mistaken assumption. Perhaps, though, mistake may be an imperfect word to use, as indeed such a thing as the mistaken line of play, exists in its own realm, and if the position doesnt bear out the sequence or line of thinking of a line of moves in reality, it did do in the realm of the mind at least, and it was certainly something felt to be beautiful at the time and correct in its own way, however divergent from the board position loked at. A quality, well thinking in this way should be encouraged by chessplay in storyland as Sophia-Venus finds her way inside the chambers of playful expressive and creative surrealistic chess play. Duchamp wants us to see the impossible as real and possible, wants us to think the impossible is real, is photographic rather than dexterous artistic creation from imagination, even though it was dexterous creative imagination and deliberate design to <mw correct="approximate" type="delrep" mv="no">aproximate</mw> the photographic but somewhat off tangent. His own story of what the art is and what the art actually is, is art itself.

		<s sv="no">We see this principle of the nature of reality and representation also in the chess pieces he claimed to have carved, he  claimed he‚Äôd carved the other pieces (pawn, rook, bishop, queen, king) but not the  knights, which he claimed somebody else had done who was a skilled  craftsman. But through empirical research and ‚Äòreality‚Äô we see that it  was actually somewhat the other way around and we can trace here a  reversal in that it was the knight that he had carved and the pieces  skillfully made on a machine. Skillfully made machine somewhat knights that are in fact made more crudely than the others in ‚Äòreality‚Äô, a strange twist to the tale of the real and its representation. Again, as in chess, things are not what they seem and as cut and dry. His knights diverge from those of the orthdox chess world, such as the Staunton figures, popular in the day and those made in the French Regency-St George period. Yet at the same time the pieces besides the knights and the kings, remain somewhat conventional too. Perhaps indicating to posterity, perhaps unintentionally that one can depart from the traditions of the past greatly ( 2 kings and 2 knights) without actually changing that much and still produce freedom, and hence the the Sophian Venusian river rolls through and out of traditions and sometimes departs radically from them, and sometimes alters slightly. I try to incorporate these features in this blog. Thus we shall see old forms and new as well as radical departures.¬† Corruption dodging in the dance of love is the way and as Lady Wisdom and Erotic Love move towards freedom, so do we, for she is ourselves, collectively and individually. This is further reinforced with the knight, mainly horses head, being derived from the shape of an art nouveau violin case, thus linking the change to this artsistic stream of art nouveau and to music, which is very apt when one considers a few things, one, that psychedelic art had its surrealistic and art nouveau edges, not to mention its music (violin case), its victoriana and edwardiana beside, and in these regions of the imagination, in psychedelic poster art, we often see a cosmic dancing Lady figure. Trails of Venus Sophia indeed! Dancing in the most curious places. Also we see elsewhere how Psychedelic poster art somewhat relates not only to Alice in Wonderland (wherein we see chess storyland connected illustrations), lyrics of Jefferson Airplane‚Äôs White Rabbit aside, but to the surrealistic version of Alice in Wonderland, the illustrations of Salvador Dali himself (in ‚Äô69), which echo the art of him who worked for Hunter Thompson, Ralph Steadman, whose version of the illustated Alice realm of chess story lands in 1967, resonates with Dalis. although Dali had no intention of this, both existing thus, one without each other being aware of the other and resonating. And why make the comparison with things future of Duchamp in his art nouveau violin case knights that have departed from the chess sets of the day? They are also resembling the Futurist tinges of the arts, which in the future indeed onwards from this chess surrealism, comes in the chess tints in the psychedelic as in Steadman‚Äôs illustrations of Lewis Carrol and also weaving its way into the psychedelic psyche via the Jefferson Airplane‚Äôs White Rabbit and also a chess allusion in Jefferson Starship on their Dragonfly album in the song Be Young You albeit in a negative light, or reflection of a more positive aspect. Jefferson Airplane who arose in the club called the Matrix, is an apt example of how Sophia-Venus leaves her trails in her escape from the classicist prisons that have gone dry and cold, forgotton and lonely, dusty and lost in the shadows, Venus Sophia Cassia emerges out intact with her chessboard through the centuries. Makes sense in a surrealistic and symbolist and even divinatory sense, even histrorically. Artists dont aim to preserve common sense anyway and the after effects of things are a part of the process of artistic way, the gradual footseps and dance of the Lady Sophia-Venus as she dances her way outside of the prison through the lattice gateways, portols and windows, especially shedding her military vestments of chess lexiconography along the way. Besides the art nouveau horse departures into future psychedelic scapes we have the absence of the Christian cross on the crown of the king, and thus the <mw correct="separation" type="subphon" mv="no">seperation</mw> of that which is holy from the imperial might, but then the chess king is holy!¬† Duchamp does this as testament to his anti clericalism, but then perhaps he genuinely knows that the emphasis upon the cross is not set in stone to be the central image of the tradition Christ belonged too and in true surrealistic iconoclasm the central idol of the idolistic version of Christ is done away with for the sake of spiritually letting in the real thing that Christ pointed towards to come back in again. Even <mw correct="inadvertently" type="subphon" mv="no">inadvertantly</mw>, outside the wishes of Duchamp himself. It can be seen like this that even if Duchamp never intended it this way anyway. Its not particularly an antagonistic view to Duchamp‚Äôs if he had another in mind too and he does say on the front of the brochure ‚ÄòCannot a new set be designed, that is, without too radical a departure from  the traditional figures‚Ä¶. Another feature of his chess set is that the queen and king merge somewhat in looking alike as a result of the removal of the cross. The Sophian and Venusian and feminine aspects of Holy Spirit and Christ resemble each other perhaps in a non androgynous state, perhaps in an all female appearing as a male and female duality theme, whatever his intentions are, we can see this way, why not? In chess story land it is so. An emasculated king we may ask? Even that too. Keep the meanings of what he meant and what it means to us open. Multifaceted. Many in the tourney exhibition of 32, especially on various different levels would have agreed with this approach, and lets not forget that here is an example of that what has happened was a happening back then that even those partaking did not know what was happening, as even we now, looking back in retrospect with our imaginations dancing do also not know what is happening. This exhibition under study, and their sets, the sculpture and paintings and how it assembled and was taken down and what was said about by the participants and other things, these are all different than what Duchamp, or anybody partaking, intended in their setting their stones and frames, iconoclastically into the liquid zone. Fluidity and change and tradition maintained, all in one. What an artistic statement!</s>
		<s sv="no">Ok, a goddess came down of the spacecraft, her gown was green, hair golden, she showed me pedestal upon which was a book inside of whose pages were not only the letters of an alphabet, but also the species of creation. The dream was very cartoonish, like an animated painting quality, of pastal and fine detailed, or of a watery coloured paint medium, fine detailed, almost photographically like computer graphic digital. It linked to a vision previously I had whilst partaking of psylocybin mushrooms, of a Goddess of green, snakes appearing in the carpet and a mystic yogin inhabiting my body as i felt em and the sun glowing with a glorious light. Ok, well how does this tie in, well for me with colour. Duchamp‚Äôs beautiful chromatic chess pieces that he laid down the foundation plans for, his green queens, green the colour of the fertile earth, of Venus, of Aphrodite. So what is her greeness? It os one divided into her power of rook and bishop (as in chess), two colours, she divides into 2, into blue and yellow, or blue and gold, the colour of <mw correct="philosophy" type="del" mv="no">philosphy</mw> and wisdom, blue and alchemy, and thus all in all I tend to see these colours in this way, in chess story scape and between this set and Conty‚Äôs Cupid garden variety there is a resonance. Thus in all three, green, gold and blue, we see the colours of Venus-Sophia and the tablet of sky blue wisdom under the alchemy of the gold of the sun. On the run through the lattice grid realms which can either expand and release or imprison. The other colours were red for the four knights and their tours and dances, prancing and chancing fortuitous hooks for the energy of the spaceship, leaping and hopping, and tracing and tying together the knots, and out the fine embroidered edges in the knights tours of the chessboard come some of the circuits that empower the craft. Along with the black and white kings and black and white pawn array this is it and their dance. If one could design a computer graphic chess software, which reclothes all the great games, first of Duchamp and then of the others, in these colour schemes and forms and graphics like beautiful diagrammes plentiful so that one could recline and see a chess game, without having to move through the pieces on the board that os one of the great benefits of technology.

The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, you can see at the end, shows how with the turning of the wheel and the knightly turning propellor, the beginnings of the spacecraft from which she will lauch into space, after sacrificing parts of her dress, as she leaves behind one, she becomes more intimate, she becaimes the bride of the bridegroom whom is one with the father and one with the ‚Äòfollower‚Äô. Her garments are given to those whom have sacrificed the marriage institution of the church and roamed into fields of free love and wheat, love of naked flesh tinging and emotional satisfaction, aided by the permutations and turnings around of chess thoughts in the craft that flies, the ariel mansion of delights. Sometimes the ideal way is to turn away from a life of naked love flesh tingles in erotic garment of imagination, that of Venus towards that of Sophia, but when the blue heights become too sterile, transcendent and remote, one realises that its her garments that are being let go off so that they can also be placed back on her, to return to her once again to her golden splendour and in new array, her garments are carried off on the spaceship, airplane of love, bearing tidings of white rabbit and Cordoban chess scapes, on the Translove airways of the freedom utopian skies psychedelic skies and they return back to her form again renewed.  ‚ÄòCannot a new set be designed, that is, without too radical a departure from  the traditional figures‚Ä¶To take her garments even away from her is away from her and to take breaks in airship propellers for a while, flying to the heights, to escape, before returning back to the ground once again in her classical forms, the naked woman ground of freedom and the church of wisdom comes around full circle.

		<s sv="no">The approach of splitting the dealing with such terms into procedurally unfair and substantially unfair is rather unique and this author knows not of any other jurisdiction within the Commonwealth that has chosen this approach.

There is also the troubling question of what would about to inadaquate justification for breach of express or implied terms of a contract. When is the justification adaquate and when is it not? Presumably this follows the approach of determining if whether the exclusion of such terms are fair and reasonable or not, but for this to work the statute itself must give an account of what ‚Äúadaquate justification‚Äù amounts to rather then just simply leave the matter for the courts. Such an approach would be in tandem with those used in other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom in their Law Commission‚Äôs proposed Unfair Contract Terms Bill 2005, specifically clase 14(1) which provides a test on how contract terms are deemed not fair and reasonable.

Trying to determine which are things personal to you and which are meaningful to the sitter can be an absolute minefield of hits and misses and is one of the reasons psychics so often appear to ‚Äòguess‚Äô things or change their answers.

		<s sv="no">I decided to focus on the bag I saw the camera being kept in as a starting place, to try and determine the gender of the owner. I saw an image of a large leathery over-shoulder handbag in my mind‚Äôs eye and figured it belonged to a woman. As we had a greater number of women in the group than men, this did not narrow down the field greatly but was a starting point. From here my scientific, rational, analytical processes changed to more psychic and illogical thought. I began to get strong impressions of random images, like photographs in my mind. This is not unusual, but since I was holding a camera it was paticularly apt. I began to see still frames taken of various scenes, and made note of them to share with the group. An outdoor area, like a park with a high old brick wall, some kindof statue or monument and some young children playing.

The incident took place at the start of the week and threw most of the nation into a total tailspin, not because her presence at fetes are unexpected; indeed, like any Trini worth her salt, the PM seems to have racked up more feting time than office hours since her return from the India Extravaganza. It seems too that on her way back from India she made a stop in London to buy a pair of pricey Louis Vuittons that she showed off to the crowd at Machel Monday. The PM‚Äôs detractors were loudly critical of her appearance on the stage as well as her dress code.

Kamla mounted a stage in an ad hoc manner representing not her private self, but the country as PM, and sought to honour a soca artiste with an award that is yet to be named, and whose reason is yet to be explained, dressed in exactly the sort of ostentatious bling that we decry in the nation‚Äôs youth when we talk of their value systems.

		<s sv="no">Before you roll your eyes and tell me my liberal leanings are prejudicing me, let‚Äôs take a moment to better define the people I am talking about; top tier, nationally known, syndicated columnists, television and radio hosts, not crazy wanks and their computer. Is there a Rush on the left? Is there a left wing talking head who is nationally known by both sides? Is there a left wing talking head currently under a $400¬† million contract? Is there a left wing talking head with a claimed 20 million listeners? Is there a left wing talking head who Democratic political leaders are afraid to repudiate? Oh sure, every now and again you hear something inappropriate from Lynn Samuels, Ed Shultz, and more frequelty than every now and again from Bill Marr. But the top talking heads on the left, in general, do not take it to the level the top from the right does. The top tier left would not <mw correct="harass" type="delrep" mv="no">harrass</mw> and stalk 12-year-old Graeme Frost, they wouldn‚Äôt call¬†the¬†Secretary of State a¬†‚Äòworthless bitch‚Äô, and they wouldn‚Äôt¬†make death threats against the President of the United States.

No left wing Rush. Some, including myself, think this is a good thing because it allows the left to legitimately claim higher moral ground. Other left leaning intellectuals I have spoken with don‚Äôt entirely agree though. The Rush method is crass, dishonest, and irresponsible; but it works. It wins elections. It moves the conversation forward for the right, and furthers the various myths that a majority of America wants no choice,¬† an ongoing war, lower pay for women,¬†¬†a bible in every state assembly, and to willfully fork over more of their income to the rich. People don‚Äôt believe all this on the whole, but by relentlessly continuing the conversation, they will start to believe that they are actually in the¬†minority. And this leads to acceptance. And that‚Äôs unacceptable. It works for the right and perhaps we should get on board, but we haven‚Äôt yet and that‚Äôs the point. The right likes to claim an equivalency not because it‚Äôs real, but because it is their version of an affirmative defense of their actions. They make no apology of saying anti-war veterans are ‚Äòphony soldiers‚Äô but feel justified in simply saying ‚Äúyeah, but your side does it too.‚Äù ¬†Sorry guys we don‚Äôt, for better or worse, and even if we did, ‚Äòhe hit me first‚Äô is not a justification for using the power of your voice to divide us rather than encourage common ground.

		<s sv="no">Anyway, we went home. The next night, a family in our compound had invited us and a few other families to the club house. The club house has two main big areas ‚Äì one where the gents sit and the other where the ladies sit. Then there is also a big dining hall besides kitchen, bathrooms and exterior verandahs. The host told us that when she was having the rooms for the party cleaned she noticed that the sofas from both sitting rooms had been brought together to one room which is kind of unusual for the club house. The place was also very dirty. Later on, we found that villa #xy basically had rented the place from the management (which is a free rental with a refundable deposit) and had given it to all these youngsters that don‚Äôt even live in our compound.

The neighbors were of course horrified. They called the religious police first who said that they are unable to enter a compound so they then called the In-charge of compound housing at the hospital. The crowd was dispersed and the manager of our compound has been fired. I am surprised that this can happen in Saudi Arabia without many repercussions. I also wonder who these partiers were. I mean were they Muslims? I am also annoyed about why villa # xy was allowed to give out our club house to outsiders. Our community is a safe place.

According to IRIN nearly 1000 surgeries, funded by the state, to reopen  womens vaginas had been performed between 2001 and 2009. In 2006  surgeons began performing clitoral reconstruction surgeries. Over 100 such surgeries have been performed at a cost of  roughly $140, well out of reach of many women in Burkina Faso.  Still there is a waiting list because not all the women who want the  surgery can be <mw correct="accommodated" type="delrep" mv="no">accomodated</mw>.

		<s sv="no">Brock Osweiler is a uniquely¬†rare and extremely special and gifted¬†athlete, football player, and quarterback. I say this because Osweiler stands an enormous 6-8 240 lbs. and looks more like a TE or OT than he does a QB. Despite all this, Osweiler‚Äôs physical ability and overall athleticism is nowhere near lacking. Brock even received a scholarship to¬†play basketball for¬†the Gonzaga Bulldogs, but eventually chose football when he¬†realized his¬†immense potential as a QB.¬†Osweiler shows more than adequate ability to escape the pocket and his top end speed and ability to scramble when the play breaks down makes him an extremely valuable and potent asset to his respective team. His 6-8 frame allows him to scan the entire field and overlook his offensive line with relative ease. Then there is this interesting nugget from ESPN Stats, ‚ÄúIn 90 NFL seasons, only 13 quarterbacks taller than 6‚Äô5‚Ä≥ have ever played a down. And none of them has ever started 75 games or thrown for 100 TDs. If there were a Hall of Fame¬† devoted to tall quarterbacks, the first-ballot selections would be 6‚Äô6 passers Derek Anderson, Scott Mitchell and Marc Wilson.‚Äù¬†A few others¬†recently joined this list as well, including¬†current players Joe Flacco (Ravens), Josh Freeman (Buccaneers), and Ryan Mallett (Patriots),¬†respectively. The verdict is still out on many of these players listed, but we are starting to see a trend of relatively good QB‚Äôs who are taller than normal make their way into the NFL and find relative success to this date. Osweiler looks to be next in this list of QB‚Äôs and may very well end up becoming the best due to his physical skill-set. Brock has an extremely gifted arm as he shows plenty of zip on intermediate to long throws and is most impressive with his general accuracy and ball placement. Last night I couldn‚Äôt help at be astonished at how accurate Osweiller was, <mw correct="particularly" type="ins" mv="no">particularily</mw> on his deep ball where he consistently¬†put¬†his throws¬†in the only place his receiver could make the play on it. Although Osweiler‚Äôs numbers weren‚Äôt overly impressive last night going 21/37 for 264 yds, with 3 td‚Äôs and two int‚Äôs, Osweiler hit many receivers in stride who were unable to haul in the pass¬†that could have drastically changed the outcome of the game. With all of this said Osweiler still has some developing to do, <mw correct="particularly" type="ins" mv="no">particularily</mw> in the areas of decision making and overall pocket awareness as he tends to force and telegraph his throws at times and drop his eyes when faced with pressure. Osweiler is still gaining experience and it was encouraging to see him stand tall in the pocket and deliver strikes with trash at his feet and defenders¬†delivering blows to his body. You can tell Osweiler has progressed this year and I have very little doubt from what I saw last night that he will not become a very high NFL Draft prospect as he continues to develop. Osweiler should be one of the top if not the top QB in the 2013 draft, should he declare after next season.</s>
		<s sv="no">Let me just say this about Burfict, dude is an absolute beast. He has incredible size, listed at 6-3 250 lbs. and displays the type of overall athleticism you would usually only find in players of much smaller stature. Burfict is explosive and can cover a lot of ground quickly. Last night‚Äôs game was a¬†little hard to get a read on Burfict as he seems to be playing much more conservatively to avoid costly penalties that can have a negative impact on his team and his draft position. Luckilly, we already know Burfict has all the physical¬†abilities in the world to succeed at the next level, however there are many issues he will need to correct to become a better overall player. Burfict has been <mw correct="labeled" type="trans" mv="no">labled</mw> as some what of a head hunter and dirty player who‚Äôs attentions go far beyond taking down the ball carrier. Due to this intense and <mw correct="aggressive" type="delrep" mv="no">aggresive</mw> style of play Burfict has been targeted many times by referees as¬†this was in full effect last night. Vontaze was consistently targeted as the opossing team and referees were enticing and antagonizing Bufict all night waiting for him to slip up, and when he did they were there to slap him with some unwaranted personal foul penalties. This has affected Burfict‚Äôs play lately as he appears tentative and afraid to make a mistake, thus taking him away from his true playing style. In last night‚Äôs game it was apparent Burfict wasn‚Äôt hustling or playing with the same type of intensity that we have seen from him in the past, and while I agree that he tends to play a little out of control sometimes, the referees don‚Äôt need to target him as much as they have in the past few games. Burfict physical capabilities are striking, however he will need to play more within himself¬† to¬†avoid costly fines and suspensions that could come his way as he tends to lead with the crown of his helmet at times. Burfict is also usually a pretty good tackler as well, but his over-agressive nature sometimes takes him out of the play as he fails to break down quickly enough to get into tackling position. Burfict definitely has the strength to bring down ball carriers with just a shoulder or arm, however I would like to see him work on his tackling form to become a better overall linebacker and player. Burfict also needs to do a little better job reading his keys and trusting his eyes as he sometimes fails to diagnose the play quickly enough. One thing that has impressed me is how difficult he makes it for opposing players to take him out of the play, Burfict is incredibly slippery and hard to engage as he¬†moves <mw correct="around" type="del" mv="no">aroud</mw> and through trash effectively. I still need to see more of Burficts overall game to see what kind of player he can become in coverage as I haven‚Äôt seen enough film just yet to make an assumption of his skill-set in this area. Burfict has a ton of potential but comes with a lot of question marks,¬†so the team who drafts him will need to be careful he doesn‚Äôt commit costly penalties and become a targeted player like Ndumukong Suh has become in the NFL.</s>
		<s sv="no">Keenan Allen is a special player with a very bright future. This was the first time I have seen Allen play and I came away more than impressed. Allen is a gifted runner in the open field and it is easy to see he¬†has the vision and overall ability to create yards after the catch. Allen <mw correct="possesses" type="delrep" mv="no">posesses</mw> a good frame at 6-3 205 lbs and will look to develop more size and strength in subsequent seasons as he is only a Sophomore. Watching Allen it is plain to see he has exciting ability to create plays in the open field. He is an extremely effective cut-back runner who shows a unique ability to see cut-back lanes and read/follow his blocks nicely. I don‚Äôt believe Allen <mw correct="possesses" type="delrep" mv="no">posesses</mw> break away speed but that is not to say he can‚Äôt beat you deep/stretch the field¬†and use his big frame and body control to shield himself from the defender and the ball. From what I saw in last nights game, Allen also runs very crisp routes and is very sudden in and out of his breaks¬†as he does a good job keeping the defender honest. It was also encouraging to see Allen working hard out on the edge to block for his team-mates and it was obvious to see he takes great pride in this part of his game.¬† Allen still has room to grow, but the future for this kid is bright‚Ä¶he may already be the best WR in the Pac-10. Keenan will go onto become the best WR to come out of California since Desean Jackson (Eagles), it will be fun to watch him and QB Zach Maynard develop chemistry over the next season or two.</s>

Many people I know don‚Äôt wish to play the multiplayer, and many more can‚Äôt play online. The same can often be said for single player aspects of games. It took me a many years to get broadband after Xbox Live was first released. I also know that there are large areas that still don‚Äôt have the required broadband to run such services. Meaning paying for full price for a game that you may only get half the access to is just plain silly. Games like Call of Duty  are very multiplayer centric, and on the other hand Mass Effect 3 the single player takes the leading role. Since I noticed online market places have been growing I always expected a game to be put up in different sections. For the past few years I was expecting an anouncment on a leading title like¬†Call of Duty¬†saying that they have thought of a new way to sell their product.</s>

In so many ways‚Ä¶their mannerisms are the same, they are both such little pieces of sunshine‚Ä¶ The other night, I got home from work and she was in her room with the door closed because we have 4 boxer dogs here right now. My SIL (sister-in-law) is part of a boxer rescue group and we have guests from time to time. She went on a tangent about how she was going to stay in her room until Bubba left, but when asked why, all she said was ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just eat my breakfast and dinner in here until Bubba leaves.‚Äù So, I just decided to hang out in her room with her. She was finishing her dinner (I cracked up laughing when I saw she was really doing that), and her room was a disaster. She likes things orderly for the most part, but her room is another story. Me, being the aunt that I am, suggest we clean her room up a bit since we are going to be hanging out in it all weekend. She loves the idea, and after a few hours of laughing, cleaning, using British accents, a bath and 2 books, she is sound asleep. During¬†the cleanup though, I found a pair of Paul Frank pj‚Äôs.

		<s sv="no">Shock Corridor fictionalises division, <mw correct="particularly" type="del" mv="no">particulary</mw> that surrounded around the divided self and the divided society. It is about divided passions ‚Äì director Sam Fuller stated in an interview about the film that ‚Äúin our society, for some reason or another, we love to hate‚Äù.

But where the musical tends to find joyous equilibrium, Fuller‚Äôs film instead seems consciously and confrontationally askew. The famous ‚Äònympho‚Äô rape sequence, for example, contradicts traditional musical genre codes by the very nature of its dark subject matter and its low-budget Noir surface, but also contains enough formal and structural similarities with the musical to make it a legitimate point of comparison.¬† Unusual representations of insanity and violence within the film such as this can be approached via Mikhail Bakhtin‚Äôs notion of the carnivalesque and its relationship to spectacle, performance and performer and may provide a significant methodology for aligning the formal aspects of the film with a broader reading whereby a divided (dual-focused, critical/spectatorial) mind is required to understand the divided (insane) world of Shock Corridor.</s>
		<s sv="no">In northwest Italy, in the Piedmont region, several outstanding varietals grow in abundance including dolcetto and barbera. However, there is one varietal that trumps all the rest; nebbiolo. Let me be honest, there are many varietals that I truly love, but no other wine makes me as excited to drink as does nebbiolo. Where its name originated from is a little unclear, but many believe the name stems from the Italian word for fog; nebbia. During the fall, a thick fogs blankets the Langhe valley, where many great nebbiolos are grown. The fog helps prevent mold during the last stage in the grape‚Äôs <mw correct="development" type="ins" mv="no">developement</mw> prior to harvest. The resulting wine goes through quite a transformation. Nebbiolos start out young and wild, almost undrinkable due to their high tannic content. In fact, most Italians refuse to drink a nebbiolo that is younger than ten years. After a proper cellaring (anywhere from 10 to 20 years!), nebbiolos become wonderfully elegant wines that taste like dried red fruits, leather, tar and cassis. I am fortunate enough to work for a winery that produces an incredible nebbiolo from our estate in southern Santa Cruz. Of course I get as many nebbiolos as I can get my hands on, and am aging several bottles of the 2004 vintage to see how they taste in 2014, 2019 and (hopefully) 2024.

He was briefly teamed up with Flournoy Miller in several shows and films following the success of their interplay in a revival of Shuffle Along. When they moved to Hollywood in the 30s, ironically Moreland got cast and Miller did not. In addition to the eye-popping, jaw-dropping, fright-wig wearing bit parts in major films that paid Moreland‚Äôs bills during the 30s and 40s, he also had many starring roles in what were then called ‚Äúrace pictures‚Äù.

		<s sv="no">Wide receiver Justin Blackmon has sometimes been given the term ‚Äúdiva wide receiver‚Äù for his play and antics on the field. However, I have been told and seen for myself that Blackmon simply is a competitor who wants the ball in key/clutch situations. Although he sometimes comes across as a player who is playing the game for himself and his own stats, that could be very far from the truth. Blackmon comes from a military background and upbringing from his father and I¬†have been told that he couldn‚Äôt be a more down to earth player off the football field. Watching more film on Blackmon I have noticed that these accusations could be unwarranted to a degree as Blackmon proved in this game to be a reliable team-mate who is a more effective blocker on the outside than he is given credit for. Blackmon did a good job positioning his body to seal off and keep his defender at bay and away from the ball-carrier. I liked to see this effort from Blackmon as some have questioned his effort in this area, especially when he isn‚Äôt the focus of the play. Justin Blackmon also has big strong hands and is a natural hands plucker. I love the big frame he has, as he squares his body to his quarterback, creating¬†¬†a big target for his quarterback to get him the football. Blackmon‚Äôs catching radius is also very impressive and has been reported to be as large as a two car garage by ESPN‚Äôs Sport Science‚Ä¶the same they measured for All-Pro NFL wide receiver Calvin Johnson of the Detroit Lions.¬†¬†On top of this Justin Blackmon shows incredible ability while the football is in the air. This was never more evident than when Blackmon timed his jump absolutely perfectly and made an adjustment to the football while in the air. This play led to a TD for Blackmon and Oklahoma State and spoke to Blackmon‚Äôs unique and extremely gifted ability to use his body in space as his spacial/kinesthetic awareness skills have <mw correct="always" type="trans" mv="no">alwasy</mw> been very good. I also enjoyed watching Blackmon compete after the catch showing good running ability and physicality as he routinely fought for extra yards instead of simply heading for the sidelines. This speaks to the type of competitor and player Justin Blackmon is and I have very little doubt that he is the most gifted receiver in the 2012 NFL Draft. I wouldn‚Äôt say that Blackmon is elite and worthy of a Top 5 pick, just because his top end speed and ability to stretch the defense isn‚Äôt on par with other game changing receivers that have went high in¬†past drafts, but Blackmon is a top 6-8 prospect in my mind. He struggled a bit with the physical play of Iowa State cornerback Leonard Johnson but was able to hold his own for the most part finishing with 10 receptions for 99 yards and a TD.</s>

Some might accuse Monroe for putting herself out there as an object, but the situation is more complicated than that. I will not get into the sad details of her life ‚Äì the foster homes, the constant abuse ‚Äì but her attitude is not one to judge. For a girl who never went to school and got married at the age of 17 for the first time, to self-educate herself, to spend long hours by reading Freud and Joyce is in itself a feminist attitude that should overcome the compromises Monroe did. However, I think it was more the public choice to see just one side of Marylin Monroe, than it was her own. If you read Jacqueline Rose‚Äôs article, you can see that Monroe did almost everything she could to put her intelligence out there, more than she wanted to put her beauty. But, people have <mw correct="preferred" type="del" mv="no">prefered</mw> to both ignore and forget that, because at the end of the day most of us just prefer to think that women are beautiful and dumb.

However, gang-studies sites like the one linked above cite a more specific history, also based in Chicago: an early leader of the Gangster Disciples (a massive Chicago street gang that developed national connections), David Barksdale, was known as "King David," and his followers adopted the symbol to honor him after his death. The "C"s featured in and around the graffiti above suggest a potential Crips affiliation.</s>

		<s sv="no">Just one more thing, because I think this has been getting lost in the shuffle: there is actual data out there about the impact pawn shops have on communities, and it reveals that pawn shops are bad for communities, for two reasons: 1) they correlate strongly with increased property crime and 2) they trap people who don't have access to credit in cycles of short-term debt that lead to long-term fiscal problems. Are pawn shops the end of the world, or even the worst thing facing Crown Heights? No, of course not - but crime and debt are serious issues, and I told Bob/Eugene as much when I spoke to him (the data I reference is linked here as well). Sure, pawn shops are legal (though the "<mw correct="jewellery" type="delrep" mv="no">jewelery</mw> store" may still be a zoning violation, in which case it is illegal), but legal and moral are not the same thing.</s>

		<s sv="no">The "Bj√∂rk" album was released in time for Christmas 1977, with a cover designed by Hildur, and photographed at a local Reykjavik studio. In contrast to precocious recordings by singing kids like Lena Zavaroni, the tone of "Bj√∂rk" mercifully falls short of the little-madam-wearing-mummy's-make-up image(although who knows what she's singing about!). Producers Gunnarsson and Karlsson constructed a perfect listenable, mid-70s pop album (albeit one sung by an 11-year old), which mixed a handful of standard Icelandic pop tunes, and a Bj√∂rk <mw correct="original" type="del" mv="no">orginal</mw> - the instrumental "Johannes Kjaval" (a tribute to a celebrated Icelandic painter) - with covers of Melanie's "Christopher Robin" (with a decent approximation of Mel's vocal growl), Stevie Wonder's "Your Kiss Is Sweet", Edgar Winter's "Alta Mira" and the Beatles' "Fool On The Hill" ( translated as "Alfur Ut Ur Hol"!). Despite her tender age, Bj√∂rk managed to press her personality into the grooves, and this, her real debut, is as much her own record as it is her producer's.</s>

And with their debut single, "Ein Mol A Mann" ("One Cube Per Head"), which contained "Ammaeli" ("Birthday") and "Koettur"("Cat"), Bj√∂rk suddenly came of age: That Voice had arrived. With precocious little shrieks, and knowing, earthy growls, her exquisite, other- wordly tones wailed with wild abandon, seemingly fit to burst with impish delight. Underpinned by the menacing, beckoning rumble of Einar, Siggi and the crew, with "Birthday" the Sugarcubes created one of the few genuinely <mw correct="original" type="del" mv="no">orginal</mw> sounds of the decade.</s>

In 1990, consolidating what had been an established, if occasional, relationship with the veteran be-bop ensemble the Tr`io Guemundar Ingolfssonar, Bj√∂rk recorded an album of jazz standards, "Gling Glo". The band's leader was the late pianist Guemundar Ingolfsson (he died shortly after the album was completed) - Iceland's only professional jazz musician - and accompanied simply by a bassist and a drummer, his trio provided Bj√∂rk with a platform for an accomplished set of jazz and popular standards.

		<s sv="no">Sigur R√≥s, let me be honest with you: I had barely heard of them. But that is where it becomes fun to be confronted by a young redactional team. From time to time they have persuasive arguments to change even the mind of a somewhat elderly chief-editor. Such as: Sigur R√≥s was top of the bill at Werchter and Pukkelpop. and moreover: de Morgen Magazine is the only one, worldwide, to do an interview with the musical sensation of 2008. And if that wasn't enough persuasive force: Belgian photographer Eva Vermandel made a photoalbum about this band. Sometimes even the most obtuse chief-editor can be moved by such arguments. So, we want to know. who are these people out of bankrupt Iceland that can inspire the young folks in Flanders so much that they even achieve the top while singing in a non-existing language? Further more there is the remarkable role played by Flemish photographer Eva Vermandel in the Sigur R√≥s saga. She made a remarkable photoalbum about the band which was added to the luxurious edition of the latest album by the band. When she was 22 she left for London in the hope of building up a career as photographer there. aAtask she managed quite well. Without much <mw correct="glamorous" type="ins" mv="no">glamourous</mw> tricks she made photographs for the Observer, the Independent magazine and worked for the Wire and British Vogue. that deserves some respect. As much respect goes to Sigur R√≥s, the counterpoint to the adage which tells us that the media is all-defining. Sigur R√≥s never needed the media, they even didn't want anything to do with it. Thus they haven't done any interviews this year, with the exception for one in the British magazine Q. How then did Bart Steenhaut managed to get to them? Shall we ever get an answer to it? Two years ago there was an appointment, but then front-man J√≥nsi left without honouring it. Now however it worked. Flemish Eva Vermandel probably provided a link. Because things work out between Vermandel and the Icelandic sensation. "I thought what she does is real art. not too styled, not too cool" we are told. Maybe the most interesting question of them all was asked at the end of the interview, especially so after the impressive performance Sigur R√≥s pulled off at Vorst Nationaal. With what sort of feeling do you hope the crowd leaves after a Sigur R√≥s concert Bart Steenhaut wanted to know. "I hope they are happy and satisfied. but above all I hope our music inspires.

		<s sv="no">The flavor is unique.  A triumverate of notes compete for dominance.  Caramel from the malt, and the spicy, resinous hops--these are familiar and unsurprising.  But then there's the salt, unmistakeable and insistent, like the brine in shellfish.  As the beer opened up, the hops emerge in a fizzy citrus note (orange).  The brewery's tasting notes offer "pine," but I think spruce, which has this citrusy quality, is closer to the mark.  Perhaps due to the saline, there's a mild <mw correct="metallic" type="delrep" mv="no">metalic</mw> note, like blood.  I got a touch of vanilla as well, perhaps from the oak.  I also got just a touch of char or smoke--probably the note BrewDog calls "tobacco."  It finishes surprisingly dryly.

Why can neither side see that there really are evil people in the world across the spectrum?  To the left I say: that person might not be a misunderstood pauper, they might just be a terrorist.

		<s sv="no">A question that comes up a lot on various homebrewing forums (or is that <mw correct="for a" type="conc" mv="no">fora</mw>?) is what to do with the spent grains from brewing.  First, for those who don't brew themselves, I should explain what I mean by "spent grains".  Beer's backbone, its main ingredient, is malted barley.  You can use other kinds of malted grain (like wheat), but barley is the principle grain in most beer.  Malting is the process of just barely sprouting the grains, then drying and lightly kilning them to halt the sprouting process.  As a kernel of grain sprouts, its chemical composition changes.  Most important for us, if you take sprouted (malted) grain, grind it up, and add hot water to form a porridge at just the right temperature (typically you end up with something in the 150 deg F range) the enzymes in the malted grain will be activated and they will begin to crack down the starch in the grain and convert it to malt sugar (mostly maltose).  Further on in the process this sugar, in turn, is converted by yeast into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</s>
		<s sv="no">Some homebrewers are concerned about their water <mw correct="usage" type="ins" mv="no">useage</mw>.  Brewing requires a fair amount of water, not only to mash and rinse the grains but also to chill the boiling wort before you add the yeast.  Again, here on our farm I don't really waste anything.  I use the very hot water that first comes out of the wort chiller to clean my equipment.  Then, when it starts to cool off, I capture it in 5 gallon buckets and use it to fill the water troughs for the animals.</s>

At the start of his BBC documentary series "The War of the World", Harvard historian Niall Ferguson makes the telling statement that the 20th Century was one long war of savagery motivated by racism among other things. What the Japanese did to the Koreans and the Chinese, what the Turks did to the Armenians and the Greeks, what the Russians did to the Slavs and Polish and other minorities, and later to the poor fleeing Germans, what the Nazi's did to the Jews and the Polish and many others, what the British did to Dresden and Hamburg and the Americans to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, what Mao did to his own people, and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, what Saddam Hussein did to the Kurds, what the Hutu's did to the Tutsi's and the Balkan peoples to each other, was in every instance motivated by some form of racism! The attacker viewing his enemy as an inferior race, or as Ferguson <mw correct="alleges" type="phon" mv="no">alledges</mw>, "vermin"! Whether Ferguson's thesis is correct is the reader's to decide, but one obvious fact strikes you if you are an Afrikaner: We did not make his list!

And that while the "racist abhorrent apartheid system" had all the means at its disposal - a pretty mighty army - and while its people had every reason to feel "justified" doing it, considering what happened to colonial Europeans throughout the rest of Africa.</s>

Even in his "rebuttal" interview after Bush's address about increasing troops in Iraq, Barack went out of his way to say that, even though he disagreed, the President was doing what he truly believed is the best for the country.

		<s sv="no">Before this, the men had lined up and raced 10,000 Meters. Stanford was both a favorite for the team, having been ranked #1 all year, and the individual with undefeated Chris Derrick having beaten last years runner-up Sam Chelanga of Liberty at Pre-Nats.The race started the same way it did last year with Chelanga exploding from the start. A good pack tucked in behind him and hoped he would come back to them as he did last year and this year at Pre-Nat's. He didn't. Chelanga continued his blistering pace and extended his lead over the chase pack which, in addition to Derrick, included David McNeill (NAU) and Barnabas Kirui (Miss.). Scanning the pack it was becoming clear that Stanford was way out of the running with Derrick's usual support cast (mainly Elliott Heath) nowhere in sight. BYU held a very early lead but it was clear that the Cowboys of Oklahoma State were running tightly knit close behind. There was no sign of German Fernandez up front, but Colby Lowe was right up there and running strong. Chelanga never faltered and ran away to a course record win of 28:41 to beat last years record of 29:03 by Oregon's Galen Rupp. McNeill pulled away from an exhausted looking Derrick and held on 29:06 to 29:14 for second. Soon after Ryan Vail and Colby Lowe came in for OSU as both were in the top 10. John Kosgei and Girma Mesecho soon followed and the outcome was a done deal. German Fernandez crossed the line in 97th (77th team score) and it was clear that he was not himself this entire season. Some of the past results showed he was off but may have been rounding into shape, although those results were skewed perhaps, as OSU seemed to tempo run to all their victories. After the race, Coach Dave Smith said German had been injured all summer and had just begun to get into training in October. While a great testament to his team ethic to <mw correct="sacrifice" type="sub" mv="no">sacrafice</mw> his ego, status, for the good of the team and to be part of the team title, one has to wonder if he would have been better off redshirting this season. He was clearly not the German the running community has revered and admired, the defending NCAA 1500 meter champion who also ran a 13:25 5000 this summer. You have to think there were some surprised runners running alongside him back there. In fact, OSU would have still won the title without him in the race at all. Hopefully, if he is not healed and ready, he will redshirt indoors and come back very strong for the outdoor season.</s>

		<s sv="no">I was pretty excited to check out the new restaurant (and the first since 130 some odd years) at the Palais Garnier Opera House yesterday. It's been open since June 27th and for an establishment which (proclaimed from the rooftops by their PR people), combined cutting edge design¬†by Odile Decq¬†that "affirms the historic building's character" and a cuisine by two star Michelin chef Christophe Aribert, it wasn't that impressive. And even less at more than 100‚Ç¨ per head. The curtain of glass enveloping the front of the restaurant gave strangely distorted views of passing Asian tourist groups and the concentrate of traffic and pollution outside, however the the red-tinged interior with ho-hum furniture, a real let down for a supposed 6 million ‚Ç¨ investment did resemble the culinary character of the place, a sort of gastronomic equivalent of a Fiat Multipla (with all options). The menu is short. The portions are tiny. We were offered two, yes two! goug√©res with our champagne (I was surprised they weren't doled out with white gloves and a pair of golden tweezers). The following "contemporary" smoked salmon with a mustard sorbet was ok, as was the trout, although as with the following Pata ¬†Negra pork chop (sprinkled with popcorn and with a honey sauce made from opera honey) , vastly overpriced. The oeufs a la neige in a red berry soup were ok as well. Just ok. When the server explained that they "opened too early" and that the chef "wasn't really in the kitchen, just a consultant" , it didn't really surprise. Clients all around were complaining about their bills. Noone seemed to be having a good time with phrases like "bof.." and "ho hum" being bandied about.

We all agreed that the prose, for which Banville is famous, is indeed striking: beautifully modulated sentences and stunning visual descriptions making the whole extremely visually vivid, (including in this case repeated descriptions of the quality of sunlight that one critic has acutely pointed out aptly chimes with the Dutch masters' preoccupation with light), though peppered throughout with archaic vocabulary - he uses words like bespeaks, tarried and athwart - and others requiring reference to a dictionary.

		<s sv="no">(And another note, on why, rather than triggering publishers' and agents' risk-averseness, new writers can actually be more attractive than established ones: A new writer is an unknown quantity. He or she could fail--but s/he could also break big. J.K. Rowling and Stephenie Meyer are extreme examples, but there are many more modest ones. An established writer, on the other hand, is a known quantity, since publishers and agents always have access to his or her Bookscan numbers--and this is not always a good thing, especially if the writer's sales have been flat over a couple of books, or if they're actually shrinking. In those circumstances, the publisher may well well feel that the untapped potential of the brand-new writer is a better investment than the <mw correct="lacklustre" type="trans" mv="no">lackluster</mw> track record of the established author, who may have proven his/her talent and professionalism, but has also demonstrated that s/he is not going to break out.

		<s sv="no">But you see, here‚Äôs the thing that is constantly made obvious to me.  Many of us carry ‚Äì to a greater or lesser extent - some kind of pain and trauma.  Inevitably it stems from our childhood. Inevitably it was linked to our parents‚Äô or some other‚Äôs pain. It finds its roots in pain that has gone on to become accepted childrearing practice  -  what Alice Miller calls the poisonous pedagogy.  It goes on to shape societies and systems of governance.  Seldom if ever did we bring the pain upon ourselves ‚Äì yet we almost always pass it on.  So there it is and there we sit with it.  What becomes pivotal is how we deal with our pain ‚Äì if we deal with it - if  we are able to deal with it.  Either we handle it and heal ourselves from it ‚Äì and it strikes me that those who do are in the minority ‚Äì for it takes resources, support, love, courage and fortitude to mine the depths of that which injured us and move on.  Or, we pass it on.  We may do so by turning it inward or we may vent our spleen on those around us ‚Äì whether we know them or not.  We try to make our issues their issues, we fail to deal with the things that make us ache and instead, like hand grenades, we detonate outwards, spreading and scattering our pain and our fear - through one means or another.  And isn‚Äôt this perhaps the root of our problems -  our and society's  failure or inability to take responsibility for personal traumas, issues, baggage - the stuff that we all carry to some extent or another?  Of course some might say, ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt ask for this to happen to me, it‚Äôs not my fault, not my responsibility.‚Äù  Actually, whether you ‚Äúasked‚Äù for it or not, it‚Äôs yours and utlimately only you can take the <mw correct="responsibility" type="del" mv="no">responsiblity</mw> - with support and love and care - to deal with it.  No one else can.  We start with ourselves, with a single step.

I accept it is not always easy, that circumstances can work against us but perhaps it is a case of to each his/her own level of challenge.  I don't know.

In other parts where soil had been gathering for longer there were the first signs of small sprouts and elsewhere fully established clumps of grasses and the flowerings of other plants.

		<s sv="no">Firefly vodka started in Wadmalaw Island, SC while I went to college in not too far away Charleston, SC.  The Firefly flagship vodka was a vodka distilled with/flavored with muscadine grapes.  It is delicious and if you can ever find any I highly recommend trying it, even as a non-vodka drinker.  It's very smooth and has just a hint of the muscadine grapes that I remember eating off of the vine at my uncles house in VA as a kid.  In a brilliant move Firefly decided to start a sweet tea flavored vodka.  I hate sweet tea, but tried the flavored vodka anyways.  It actually tasted like sweet tea and was not overly sweet, which was impressive, but I still hated it due to my dislike of sweet tea.  Since then Firefly has sourced the production of this flavored vodka to (I <mw correct="believe" type="trans" mv="no">beleive</mw>) Florida, and has since added too many different flavor choices to recall.  To this day Firefly has yet to send it's original vodka to TX and many other states that carry the sweet tea variety.

I have been craving the original Firefly and have held out contacting SC buddies for it hoping it would make it's way to TX but it would appear it is not distributed my the same means as the sweet tea flavored variety.</s>

I can smell the sweet malts and flowery hops on this baby. Straw colored with a poofy Mother of Pearl colored head. I'll let my two fingers of head settle and have more swine. It pops in big bubbles and is taking it's sweet time. And the head has a bit of lace on it as well. Some more rice and swine, and now for the booze itself...better be bomb...I've tasted much hoppier, but it's very good. Strong hops with strong malt for balance. Medium carbonation and my tongue is still feeling the bitterness a full 60 seconds afterward. The wife tells me it's 8.5% ABV, cool beans. My tongue is ubertingly. Another draught...goes down smooth and pretty durn drinkable, medium-to-full body. Yes. I may like Broken Halo IPA a little better...I need to review them officially some day.

I even called a friend I hadn't talked to in 2 years. Hops mfing Wallop. Sounds like something out of an Amos &amp; Andy show. Brothas would be so fired up if this cat was black. About halfway down and it's tasting a little better. I let it warm up, so it's about 60 F now. I don't care what the wife says, I'm getting another helping of rice. He's hot, he's spicy, he taste great, he's Curry MAN!!! Damn this stream of consciousness crap.

You can't get a beer that's probably twice the alcohol of a Miller Lite, and be able to hide it through the whole 12 ounce experience, that's what I'll have to call my review style, the "12 ounce experience".

She had worked as an assistant to David and Albert Maysles, whose 1969 film Salesman is considered a landmark in the "Direct Cinema" movement emphasizing the camera as observer.  This North American-centered movement was connected in spirit to the British Free Cinema movement of the 1960s which, as Barnouw describes, "often poked into places society was inclined to ignore or keep hidden."  The Maysles had followed a number of door-to-door Bible peddlers in Florida, most certainly a milieu that had been ignored in mass-media portrayals up to that point.  But it was also the methodology of the Maysles that had made Salesman remarkable: the intimacy of a very small crew of image and sound recorders (just the Maysles brothers themselves), a lack of extra-diegetic material such as voiceovers and graphics, and an emphasis on the synchronization of sound with picture, giving the voices of the salesmen and their customers a real-time authenticity that had been all but technologically impossible a decade or so before.

There‚Äôs been no point in the past four years at which the public has been given a meaningful chance to decide whether something this big and transformative should be built on public property. Instead, race, basketball, and Frank Gehry have been tossed out as distractions to steer attention away from the real issue, money. Ratner‚Äôs team has mounted an elaborate road show before community boards and local groups, at which people have been allowed to ask questions and vent, and the developer has made a grand show of listening, then tinkering around the edges. But the fundamentals of the project‚Äîan arena plus massive residential and <mw correct="commercial" type="trans" mv="no">commerical</mw> buildings‚Äîhas never been up for discussion. Ratner, with Gehry‚Äôs aid, has built a titanium-clad, irregularly angled tank and driven it relentlessly through a gauntlet of neighborhood slingshots.

		<s sv="no">Remember the days when one used to be proud of simply being British and equally as proud of those very famous, world-renowned British companies that earned this country so much respect overseas? Neo Liberalism has infected almost every walk of life in this country and gained tremendous strength since the ‚ÄúIron Lady‚Äù ‚Äì Maggie Thatcher took over the reins of Britain back in 1979. We have, since those early days, seen this country and its once proud industries become fragmented and sold off to the European Union or some other overseas entity which is clearly a New World Order brain child!! We all watched Zionist backed organisations descend over this country, like a huge grey cloud and watched them rain down, flood and destroy the pride of British industry! Who are they, where did they come from and how did it happen? I guess World War Two has to be the turning point when these Zionist regrouped to form their own elite group that would become the foundation of the term Neo Liberalism and the birth of the New World Order. It became evident to them that someone could make big money by the privatisation of national industries, especially in areas such as water, gas and electricity etc. One can clearly see that they have come a long way since those early days resulting in extremely high cost that has now caused so much suffering to the aged and poor of this world. I guess it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they tax you for breathing oxygen!! I believe that the birth of the New World Order started around 1947 when a Friedrich Hayek formed an elite group called The Mont Pelerin Society that consisted of widely scattered neoliberal thinkers and political figures. The Society see the danger in the expansion of government, not least in state welfare and in the power of trade unions!! Hayek realised that the only way he could force change was to form and intensive discussion group of like minded intellectuals into a ‚ÄúWorld Central Planning Group.‚Äù The group would meet annually and consisted of a kind of ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Who‚Äù in US and European society. The first meeting consisted of mainly Americans but within 10 years would see the control being handed over to Europeans, which it does to this day. It was during their first meeting when Hayek realised that this group could in actual fact change the policy around the world. Two very influential men were also at that meeting, Henry Simmons who trained Milton Friedman (future President of the Society) and Sir John Clapham a senior official at the Bank of England who also so happened to have been the past President of the British Royal Society If one links such a group with the Bilderberg Group one can see a similar trend in their practices and no doubt with the same goal to create a ‚ÄúOne World Government.‚Äù Neo Liberalism started to kick of in a big way from the 1970s onwards as it spread across the world. I guess the term ‚ÄúGlobalization‚Äù is very much part of their thinking and has consequently increased the level of poverty in all four corners of the globe‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I found one term used some years ago was to ‚ÄúMake Poverty History‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..this from my perspective was an absolute joke and I found it extremely offensive because it was the introduction of Neo Liberalism and Globalization that accelerated poverty and remains so to this day. With the arrival of Maggie Thatcher in 1979 this country started to be not only taken apart but also introduced massive fraud as the new elite found ways of ripping off the system. It was in my birthplace, the City of Derby, which became the backbone,  for not only the birth of the Industrial Revolution but also a city of technological excellence. However, with the arrival of the ‚ÄúIron Lady‚Äù we were to see the progressive demise of this once proud city. We saw the privatization of British Rail which by 1994 was handed over to Railtrack. Overtime we saw the Railway Technology Centre fall by the wayside and the only real activity that still exists is that of Bombardier, a Canadian company.. Many railway contracts have since gone to Europe leaving little work locally. The collapse of British industry continued as we saw other cities such as Coventry fall by the wayside with the collapse of Land Rover and MG  and many other traditional British companies fall into the hands of Europe or as in this case China. Then we have the question of regional airports and regional airlines and how control of these has now gone offshore or have been taken over by European based consortiums. Many regional airports were once controlled by local councils that surround them and were clearly being run like a national based entity. However, since we joined the European Union we have seen control of these airports and many airlines fall in the hands of other EU companies. The biggest issue being that tenders for contracts now have to be issued to the EU and not to British Companies and likewise the sale of airports or airlines. I would ask the question why monopolies are allowed to be formed when the very principal of monopolies is highly illegal in that it takes away fair competition with the spin off being the public have to pay more as they no longer have the choice!! We saw the change of airport ownership pass from regional councils to such companies as the British Airport Authority (BAA) which was far from being British. BAA is owned by a consortium led by Grupo Ferrovial,  a Spanish firm specialising in infrastructure. The group became one of the world‚Äôs largest transport companies and controlled many of our major airports and was clearly in breach of monopoly regulations. We saw many top British Airlines loose their national identity when they were taken over or became involved with other EU airlines i.e. BMI taken over by Lufthansa and BA joining forces with yet another Spanish company, Iberia and now owned by IAG. IAG has taken over BMI which will now close down‚Ä¶..don‚Äôt you find it strange that it was BA who sold many of it‚Äôs Middle East aircraft and routes to BMI (Lufthansa) and who now have purchased BMI‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..are we seeing the emergence of a ‚ÄúOne World or One EU Airline‚Äù Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines clearly knows what is going on and continues to fight the politics of ‚ÄúThatcherism‚Äù under the leadership of David Cameron who is clearly a ‚ÄúNew World Order Puppet‚Äù as is Nick Clegg and the Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband all of whom swear their allegiance to the Zionist cause!!# On the topic of airports we now see BAA (Spanish) selling off some of its regional airport, such as Edinburgh,  which has now been purchased by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) an American company with strong ties with Credit Suisse Bank ‚Ä¶.they also own London Gatwick via Ivy Bidco. Maybe by now you are starting to see how the New World Order is able to break down any countries industrial base  and almost force mergers or joint ventures that have only one purpose‚Ä¶..to put all their ‚ÄúGolden Nest Eggs‚Äù into one basket. One the banking side we again saw the intentional collapse of Abbey National (who had branches in every city in the UK) who were then taken over (on the cheap) by Santander the Spanish banking giant who now, very conveniently, have their name plastered on all the old Abbey National Banks in every city. Before closing this article I would like to express my concerns regarding the only major industry left here in Derby, that being Rolls Royce, who,  as you all know,  design and manufactures both civil and military jet engines/turbines. There orders have now gone through the roof and so one would ask the question that if your orders are about to double would you not expand your existing business to cope with the upsurge or build a suitable large facility to cope with demand? In this case our corrupt and fraudulent government has allowed 50% of this expanded business/ production (of Trent  series engine)‚Äù to be produced in Singapore‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ which obviously has a sinister political overtone!! They say that Singapore has the space for a purpose built facility for such expansion and that it has nothing to do with a cheaper work force ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..oh really!!!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so what about keeping British Technology in this country and using British Technicians?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what about Rolls Royce taking over any of the now redundant RAF bases and building a purpose built factory in this country‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.boy oh boy one can sense a rather bad smell coming from our current ‚ÄúThatcherite Government‚Äù that is destroying this country!! I should add that another explanation offered is that they need to produce one Trent engine per day or around a minimum of 250 per annum and that the Government of Singapore and the Singapore Educational Department can offer them the skilled workforce required for such an expansion‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this will employ around 1,000 highly skilled workers!! Welll  Mr. Cameron we already have that skilled workforce in Derby and a local Technical College that RR supports as a pool for its future workforce!!! With David Cameron at the helm of this country and with Ed Miliband sitting on the side lines what chance do we Brits have in getting this country back to being simply British? What chance do we have at restoring the high tech companies that once formed the backbone of this country? What chance do we have at saving the sovereignty of this country? The answer my friends is ‚ÄúNO CHANCE‚Äù!! This country has now been consumed by the European Union which is controlled by the New World Order. Our military has now diminished into a force that could barely defend itself and is thus totally <mw correct="dependent" type="subphon" mv="no">dependant</mw> on the NWO military ‚Äì NATO!!# Now our wonderful Prime Minister, David Cameron or the other NWO  puppet Ed Milliband will destroy the United Kingdom and its sovereignty by allowing  the Scots, Irish, Welsh and English to break away and become fragmented before handing the entire country over to the ‚ÄúUnited States of Europe‚Äù. Having just celebrated Shakespeare‚Äôs Birthday and St Georges day I found it to be a dismal  event watched by only a handful of people here in Derby‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.historically the entire Market Place was adorned with medieval tents, knights in shining armour on horseback and everything that was typically English‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.on Sunday I saw a pathetic turnout of a small group of actors with the St Georges cross being laid upon a camouflaged background and not the standard red cross on a white background‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..a bit of humour with a sword fight and the slaying of the dragon‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and the only true English group being the Morris Dancers.. For the second year the whole of the Market Place was taken over by a massive circus type tent being used by the Shemales from Thailand‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.such is the ethical and moral demise of this city and this country. Doesn‚Äôt it make you feel so proud to be British and to see our puppet leaders ‚ÄúF‚Ä¶ Up‚Äù this country of ours!! Well Mr. Fraudulent Cameron, Tory Party/Lib Dems, New Labour (under their Zionist leader Ed Miliband) your combined ignorance is personified by your lack of interest in stamping out the massive fraud and corruption that many of you are involved in. My next article will open up another ‚ÄúHornets Nest‚Äù that is indirectly linked with David Cameron‚Äôs massive fraud known as the ‚ÄúBig Society Capital‚Äù except I would go a step further by saying this goes into the top of ‚ÄúVery High Society Capital‚Äù with Royal connections!!! It will make the Prince of Wales flinch and add new meaning to that famous Welsh song: We‚Äôll keep a welcome in the hillside We‚Äôll keep a welcome in the Vales This land you knew will still be singing When you come home again to Wales Believe me this will be the scoop or all scoops!!</s>

I'm not a Catholic, and my understanding of Christian liturgy is elementary as best, but this may be the <mw correct="archetype" type="del" mv="no">archtype</mw> of the transformation story: through torture, scourging, and <mw correct="crucifixion" type="phon" mv="no">crucifiction</mw>, Jesus realizes his transformation from human to divine.

So I told the doctor to start the IV fluids and do what he could.  To help defray some of the cost, I took him home that night instead of paying for an overnight stay in the animal hospital.  I put him in a cardboard box and wrapped him up in a blanket.  Before I went to bed, I looked at him in the box and he looked back at me.  For some silly reason, seeing this cat in a box made me think of Schrodinger's Cat, which refers to a well-known (at least among science geeks like me) scientific paper written by physicist Erwin Schrodinger in 1935.  So I decided to name him Schrodinger.  I figured he would either be dead or alive in the morning, so the name seemed appropriate (if you don't know what I mean by that, click this link and you can read all about Schrodinger's Cat).</s>

		<s sv="no">Republicanism is a form of historicism since it deals with sequence of events, events themselves and political interactive relationships. Basic conflict is explaining human sequences. Medieval thought avoided it by not creating a historicism. Rationality dealt with universals. Historicism itself was questionable because it by necessity was about time and contingency which were inherently not rational. With the Greeks, history as a philosophy was not solved or seen as a problem. Aristotle's cyclic view of time based on the perfect sphere served as a metaphor for time in human interactions. It took other modes of thought superseding the Christian one to develop an historical frame of reference for the temporal or human. Christianity discarded the cyclical view because of the obvious constraints it imposed on a God outside and superior to time. Philosophy itself was inadequate to reconcile universals within a temperal context. Political society is time bound, <mw correct="contingent" type="del" mv="no">contigent</mw> and particular. New modes of thought developed outside of <mw correct="philosophy" type="del" mv="no">philosphy</mw> to deal with this fact.

As well as being a pub chain owner, he is now a brewery owner - he owns Roosters of Harrogate, so he has a foot in more than one camp.  His article is wide ranging and sensible in the main. He calls for an awareness campaign of the difficulties of running pubs, a closer working relationship with organisations where we have common cause and a more relaxed attitude to craft beer.

It's bigger in grain and roasted flavor, but the vinous taste is much lower than usual.  Some get out of hand though, so that's a good thing in a way.

Edun in particular which grows on me with every season, had a very cool ease about it. The sort of collection that has been styled well but would still serve you well once the outfits have been deconstructed and individual pieces worn. It always niggles me when you realise a collection that looked so wonderful on the catwalk was down to canny styling and it's brilliance doesn't quite translate onto the rails.</s>

		<s sv="no">Only seven, and already self conscious?  And this from an otherwise confident, head-strong leader.  I was reflecting on the term: self-conscious.  Conscious of self.  It has a negative connotation, but there's nothing <mw correct="inherently" type="subphon" mv="no">inherantly</mw> wrong with feeling yourself.  So I thought why when we feel "self-conscious" we feel insecure, doubtful, like we are awkward inside our own skin.  I think it's because we really are created to seek out and rely on Him who created us, not ourselves.  If we remember that God has a plan for us, and if we follow Him, He'll help us get there (in spite of ourselves).  I also don't tend to feel self-conscious if I'm thinking of others.  It might be awkward to go take a plate of cookies to a new neighbor, but if I think of them and their need to be welcomed and feel accepted, instead of my awkwardness and what they will think of me, then it becomes (slightly) easier.</s>

		<s sv="no">How does street fishing differ from simple fishing though? In many ways, there is no difference, with the fundamental aspects of fishing remain the same no matter what environment. The techniques necessary for the activity are important skills for people to learn at any age, but perhaps particularly the young. Pierron lists observation, self-control and humility as being especially important as well as an awareness of your surroundings and learning the basic gestures of the discipline. It can give individuals a real sense of achievement too. As Pierron explains, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the same as life as a whole ‚Äì there is good luck and bad luck, but success or failure in fishing are <mw correct="dependent" type="subphon" mv="no">dependant</mw> on the choices we make. You need to have a basic understanding of nature and fish, and what we manage to catch is the concretisation of what we have learned and understood‚Äù.

		<s sv="no">There are however two ways that street fishers do like to differentiate themselves from other members of the fishing community. Firstly, the activity should no longer be seen as sedentary, but one based on mobility. The street fisher uses lightweight material, and moves around to find the best spot at a particular moment. Secondly, street fishers never keep fish out of the water for any significant length of time, and never eat their catch. ‚ÄúWe are militants‚Äù explains Pierron, ‚Äúmilitants for a modern, responsible form of fishing‚Äù.

		<s sv="no">"In Gloucestershire, England, 1970, five musicians got together to rehearse, producing one of the most innovative and under rated rock bands of the seventies. The original idea for this band was first conceived in a hotel room in New York City, by Peter Solley and Keith Webb. At the time, they were the opening act for The Rollingstones, with the Terry Reid Band. Deciding to break away from the creative restrictions imposed on them as backing musicians, they returned to England to form their own band called PALADIN. Many months were spent finding the right blend of musicians, writing and rehearsing. The band consisted of Lou Stonebridge on vocals, piano, and harmonica, Derek Foley on guitar and vocals, Peter Solley on organ, piano, violin and vocals, Keith Webb on drums and percussion, and Peter Beckett on bass and vocals. Stonebridge and Foley had been playing with the band Grisby Dyke, and Peter Beckett was formerly of the band WORLD OF OZ. When the rehearsals began, it was clear that PALADIN was going to be a dynamic live band. Instead of recording a demo, they invited people from the music industry to attend the rehearsals. Their sound was a mix of rock, blues, soul, jazz, and latin, creating a rich blend of world beat, long before it existed. PALADIN'S use of dual keyboards also created a unique sounds. By the end of 1970, they hit the road to play live gigs. Their first appearance took place at the Revolution in London. After some negogiations, PALADIN signed with the newly formed Bronze Records. They began recording their self-titled, debut album on January 8, 1971, at Olympus Studios in West London. They also recorded some of the album at Island Studios, also in London. They recorded almost everything live in the studio, with a few overdubs. This <mw correct="decision" type="del" mv="no">decison</mw> produced some outstanding pieces of music. A year later, it was time for their second album, which was recorded at the famous Apple Studios in London. Entitled CHARGE!, the second album was pegged by critics to be the absolute classic masterpiece of the 70's. This diverse album, which at times mixed folk with rock and roll, made it difficult to pinpoint influences. The lead vocals were shared by the band members on select songs. Famous album cover artist Roger Dean, designed THE PALADIN, a rider on a horse, for CHARGE!, claiming it to be one of his most difficult sketches. Unfortunately, PALADIN'S lack of success led to frustration, with Stonebridge and Foley deciding to leave the band in the middle of 1972. Foley was replaced by Joe Jammer on vocals and guitar. However, the revised lineup didn't last long and by the end of the year, PALADIN disbanded. The career of PALADIN produced two of the finest hard/prog albums of the 70's. They also recorded early versions of tracks leaning more toward jazz. These were later reworked and the tapes were forgotten for almost 25 years until their release in 2002 by Rock Symphony under the name of JAZZATTACK. PALADIN did record live for the BBC but the tapes are believed to be still collecting dust in the vaults of old Beeb in London. Today, Peter Solley owns Peter Solley Productions, a company that produces MIDI files." (www.peterbeckett-player.com)</s>

		<s sv="no">The penultimate, and arguably most famous, portion of the film concerns the collision of humanity that is the modern metropolis. Spanning the United States' biggest cities from New York to Los Angeles, this is the most vibrant sequence in Koyaanisqatsi, and has proven divisive over the years for its portrayal of human beings as mindless automatons. Fricke once again employs his time-lapse technique to speed up the action; however, since human beings move at a considerably greater momentum than clouds, the result is a dizzying blur of activity that resembles nothing so much as a colony of ants in distress. There is a tremendous beauty in this sequence, borne of seeing our everyday interactions in an alien fashion: Escalators and revolving doors churning out people like fodder; shopping malls and train stations swarming with commuters; nighttime traffic coalescing into a single shimmering fluorescent strip. A voyage through America's blue-collar substrata yields footage of hot dogs firing out of an automatic linker machine and Twinkies cruising along a <mw correct="conveyor" type="subphon" mv="no">conveyer</mw> belt to their destiny; postal workers and tailors complete their work by hand, while the integrants of an auto assembly line move as one with their machinery. It is a symphony of organized chaos, a rapturous ode to the mechanics of capitalism, and it builds to a climax of near-subliminal speed as the whole holy mess is viewed from inside a moving vehicle. The music grows in intensity along with the film, all glittering arpeggios and euphoric chorales, until one feels completely overwhelmed‚Äîbut at the moment everything reaches a fever pitch, the emergency brake is pulled, and we are ejected into the final stage of Koyaanisqatsi.</s>

		<s sv="no">But, recognizing political realities does not mean that it makes me happy. I'm not saying that I want the pre-midterm election partisan rancor, but at least progressive policies were still being pushed by the president and congress. It seems as though the president is now going to ride out the next two years of his term by reaching out to republicans, and campaigning to the center, for president. We'll see how this works out for the president, but I think (as I've thought before) that he's making a big mistake in pandering to the Republicans in congress, because the hard line stances that they held in the previous two years have not been softened since the midterm elections, but instead have been hardened by the fact that they have more power. I think Republicans actions over the last two weeks is evident that the Republicans are not looking to work with President Obama the progressive democrat, but instead want to work with President Obama the guy who needs to become more centrist to reach out to <mw correct="independent" type="subphon" mv="no">independant</mw> voters to win a second term.</s>

Conceived in 1866 by Frederick Law Olmstead and Calvert Vaux, the celebrated designers of Central Park, Crown Heights' grandest street was built between 1870 and 1874. Olmstead and Vaux coined the term "parkway" to describe their vision of a landscaped road built specifically for "pleasure-riding or driving," sketching out a 55-foot wide carriage drive between two pedestrian malls with four rows of trees stretching more than two miles. Originally adorned chiefly with American Elms, the parkway now offers a lush landscape of more than 1,100 trees in 24 separate <mw correct="varieties" type="del" mv="no">varities</mw>.

		<s sv="no">Here's the problem I have with teleological fiction: It is essentially the sensationalization of history. Push it further (especially in the case of Exodus), and it can lead to the creation of popular myth. My uncle isn't the only person I've met who's cited Exodus as their source on early Israeli history. I see a similar thing happening with people quoting Dan Brown in reference to the history of the Catholic Church. This isn't intended to be a scathing criticism of Exodus or the Da Vinci Code - both are great, fun books. In fact, if you're gonna read those two, read Exodus' requel "The Haj," and the Da Vinci Code's prequel "Angels &amp; Demons."

Some of them know their knowledge limits better than others. Whilst one waitress sensibly rushed to fetch the sommelier when our questions were too difficult for her, another insisted on making quite the show of her ignorance after we'd ordered a glass of something she'd recommended.

She simply named the project 'treasure book' and didn't give much direction after that other than to say it was to be a book of some kind with its theme being 'treasures.'

I let it sit in my art room for a couple of weeks and didn't rush it. Each day, when I'd look at it slowly and carefully, I'd see it in a new way, which resulted in my adding a little here, a little there or taking away a little here, a little there.

Whether they rent or buy. But some people can't afford the home they need. This has resulted in a housing market that led to the near collapse of the economy. In previous decades we controlled rents so that people could afford them. Governments regularly fiddle with interest rates as a way of managing the economy. This results in the fluctuation of what people pay for the homes they have bought. Let's control rents and let's also control the price of houses for sale so borrowing to pay for them becomes affordable. Otherwise we quite simply continue to say that 5% of our people can rot in hell.</s>
		<s sv="no">This below from Brian Gerrish, a Former British Navy Lft Commander."Common Purpose, a criminal organisationthat abuses government posts for gain.Although it has 80,000 trainees in 36 cities, 30,000 graduate members and enormous power, CommonPurpose (CP) is largely unknown to the general public.It recruits and trains its leaders to work "beyond authority," to abuse their posts and serve CommonPurpose, instead of their own departments, which they then undermine. Its members control the NHS,where it wastes ¬£60 billion, much of it going into private pockets; and controls most of Britains 8,500quangos which spend ¬£167 billion annually, according to the Cabinet Office. Most of that is waste.Business rates and tax go up, services go down, the difference is spent on yet more CP quangos.CP is identifying leaders in all levels of our government to assume power when our nation is replacedby the European Union, in what they call ‚Äúthe post democratic era.‚Äù They are learning to rule withoutdemocracy, and will bring the EU police state home to every one of us.Common Purpose is a criminal organisation that enables fraud to be committed across thesegovernment departments to reward pro European local politicians. Corrupt deals are enabled that putproperty or cash into their pockets by embezzling public assets.It has members in the NHS, BBC, the police, the legal profession, the church, many of Britain‚Äôs 8,500quangos, local councils, schools, social services, the Civil Service, government ministries, Parliament,and it controls many RDA's (Regional Development Agencies).Cressida Dick is the Common Purpose senior police officer who authorised the "Shoot to kill" policywithout reference to Parliament, the law or the British Constitution. Jean de Menezes was one of theinnocents who died as a result. Her shoot to kill policy still stands today.Common Purpose trained Janet Paraskeva, the Law Society's former Chief Executive Officer.Surprising numbers of lawyers are CP members. It is no coincidence that justice is more expensive,more flawed and more corrupt. Lawyers in secret family courts routinely commit perjury to pervert thecourse of justice, knowing CP judges will protect them; a fair trial is now rare. When a challenge wasmade to the signing of the five EU treaties, which illegally abolish Britain's sovereignty, it was nosurprise the courts refused to uphold the law.Common Purpose was backed by John Prescott's Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM), and itsChief Executive is Julia Middleton. The Head of the Civil Service Commission is a memberIt is close to controlling Plymouth City Council, where is has subverted the democratic process. Localpeople cannot get CP's corrupt activities published, because the editors of local papers are in CP, andrefuse to let journalists publish the articles.The power of councillors is being usurped nationally by council executives, as CP substitutes ‚Äúexpertofficers‚Äù and swamps councillors with paperwork and directives. The ODPM‚Äôs councillor monitoringofficers can remove councillors who don‚Äôt comply, or try to stand up for democracy.CP was formed in 1970 by Ted Heath's Conservative Party as part of joining the European UnionDictatorship. In the 1990‚Äôs, with its members' cross departmental influence, it was involved with whatthen became the disastrous New Millennium Dome Company and the squandering of ¬£800 million; itappears ¬£300m of this was diverted into the web of quangos set up by CP. There is a fraud case overthis, stalled in the courts thanks to CP's influence in the legal profession.Over ¬£100 million of our money has been spent on CP courses alone, and its been hidden from thepublic. No published accounts, and members names are a guarded secret. It charges substantialfigures for its courses. Matrix for example costs ¬£3,950 plus VAT, and courses for the high flying‚Äòleader‚Äô can be as much as ¬£9,950 plus VAT. This money is ours, paid by government departmentsfinancing senior staff to become agents for CP, instead of loyal to their own jobs.Common Purpose International (Ltd by guarantee No. 2832875) is registered as an educational charity,No 1023384. Given it targets the powerful with expensive fees, its charity status stinks and should berevoked..Common Purpose - training our future EU rulers - continuedÙÄÄÅPotential Common Purpose subjects are selected for training.

If so they are selected for the inner sanctum; but half arenot, and can honestly say they've seen nothing wrongTrained leaders are encouraged to act as a network, enable other members' plans, and have meetingsunder the so called Chatham House rules. This effectively means their statements are not attributableto them, nor can attendees reveal information heard at a Common Purpose meeting.Council Officers are having secret meetings with, for example, property developer Common Purposefriends. No agendas and no minutes. Common Purpose Graduates from the public quango sectorssuch as the Regional Development Agencies attend, and award large sums of public money to theseprojects.It is the worst national example of cronyism, closed contract bids, fraud and corruption. And unseen <mw correct="to the" type="conc" mv="no">tothe</mw> general public.Common Purpose undermines traditionally effective and efficient government departments with anoverwhelming influx of new language, political correctness and management initiatives. The talk is ofchange, empowering communities, vision, worklessness, mainstreaming (sucking EU money into aproject to sustain it), community empowerment, working partnership, regeneration and celebratingdiversity etc etc. Documents appear about change, and reorganisation.As CP ‚Äúleaders‚Äù become more senior they employ countless managers and bureaucrats. In timeconfusion rules, and things don‚Äôt seem to work properly. Management decisions are made that seemstupidly destructive. The organisation‚Äôs performance becomes sluggish. Undermining the NHS isCommon Purpose‚Äôs biggest success so far, with bureaucrats outnumbering hospital staff three to one.David Cameron, who is an EU plant, uses the language and techniques of Common Purpose againstthe Conservative Party. By changing, with nothing to change to, he is paralyzing the Conservativeparty.Common Purpose specifically targets children from the age of 13, and more recently age 4, for sex orleadership and citizenship training. Yes, it is active in schools, and again the average parent has noidea.People have contacted us to speak of their experiences with Common Purpose. A common theme isits all sweetness and light, until you fail to follow the direction set by the CP leadership. Theninteresting things happen. Ladies in particular have been bullied at work, some have lost their jobs,some have become paranoid and depressed at the pressure from people ganging up on them.A typical story is a husband describing the decline in his wife from the time she becomes a CommonPurpose graduate. Loss of sparkle, enthusiasm, anxious and ‚Äòchanged‚Äô, and she initiated a divorce.Other Common Purpose people lie when they are challenged as to their involvement.Common Purpose candidates are given a two day residential course in which they are ‚Äòtrained‚Äô in aclosed residential environment, such as a small hotel. They are encouraged to reveal personalinformation about themselves, such as their likes, dislikes, ambitions and dreams. Discussions are thencontrolled by the course leaders. Some participants have likened this to Delphi technique, NLP, or theapplication of group psychology such as Cognitive Dissonance or brainwashing.If you suspect Common Purpose is active in your organisation, or see a pattern of incredibly baddecisions, money being wasted, notice bullying, fraud, or threats, note the names of those involved(we've tracked down over a thousand) and please contact us. And publish the truth about CommonPurpose as widely as you can.Brian Gerrish 07841 464187, David Noakes 07974 437097; http://eutruth.org.uk for action."</s>

It seems as if half of Europe is glowing and so I couldn't resist but to take one of my some-while-ago purchases and put it on. This jacket is the perfect creation for a wonderful day out and meanwhile keeps some flashy details that let it even match for a casual dinner. The material (100 % cotton) feels supercomfy and rather gave me the impression of wearing a jumper instead of a jacket that slowly but surely makes it into my spring/summer-favourites list. The neon stripes add that vibrant touch and then again maintain that certain order (I love) when mingling with low-keyed grey. The destroyed tucks at the end of the sleeves and the neckline <mw correct="induce" type="subphon" mv="no">enduce</mw> that little rebellious something, which builds a contrast to the cut and material. The detail that adds this elegant and special twist are the golden chains and especially that oversized zipper. I just love how different elements come together on one item and create a completely new and refreshing look.</s>
		<s sv="no">The kriek started off as a Flanders Red, which I brewed in Brooklyn with Ray in August of 2008.  I kegged it before we moved to Portland, and even served some before deciding that it was just a little too <mw correct="lacklustre" type="trans" mv="no">lackluster</mw> and needed some extra souring.  I still had about 4 gallons of beer, which I topped off with a little Belgian Dark Strong and some of the new Flanders red brewed with Al B's bug blend.  I added a bunch of fresh cherries and some oak chips almost 3 months ago, and I am finally happy with the flavor.</s>

		<s sv="no">Children do love stories about children who are even naughtier than themselves.  Go to a primary school on their Dressing-Up As A Children's Book Character Day, and you always bump in to multiple Pippi Longstockings and Horrid Henrys.  Well, there's a new kid on the block as far as fictional naughty children go, and her name is Martha Bones.  As a middle child myself, I relate to Martha, loathing her goody-goody older sister, jealous of her can-do-nothing-wrong baby brother, vying with friend/enemy next door, but expressing all those familiar feelings in such joyously REALLY NAUGHTY ways (she bit Father Christmas, for goodness sake!) that she's a real pleasure to read about.  It's Martha's view of events that we get, and we very quickly realise that her views are somewhat prejudiced.  A few sentences into the story we are told - 'It wasn't fair, she thought.  anybody could accidentally drop their sister's library book down the toilet.  And then pull the flush.  anybody could accidentally write Baby For Sale <mw correct="across" type="insrep" mv="no">accross</mw> their baby brother's head.  In green felt-tip.  The Non-Wash-Offable kind.'  Isn't that escalating of naughtiness to the point of wickedness delicious?!  But a reluctant and incompetent Interstellar Agent (an updated form of Guardian Angel) called Fred is soon doing battle to make Martha good.  The results of their tussle are fast-moving and slapstick, with situations all too <mw correct="familiar" type="del" mv="no">familar</mw> from real family life, but taken here to enjoyable extreme.  But this isn't just a comic romp of a book; it also lightly explores something of the complexities of goodness and badness to show that things aren't always black and white, and that adults as well as children struggle with goodness.</s>

They are just starting to turn red and I'll be able to pick some later this weekend. I noticed my aubergine plants are just flowering... probably a little late, but it's good to see what the flowers look like. I noticed the cabbages are ready to start picking, and celery is growing strong, my brussel sprouts are the size of peas and will be ready for a lovely late autumn/winter harvest, I've got some beetroot big enough to roast, and well... I could write a long long list. </s>

		<s sv="no">The most critical thing to in any kind of narrative or with a transition between scenes is to remember that every word and revelation has to count. Everything¬†we include needs to be new and critical information for the reader either on an emotional or informational level. Ideally, it should multi-task the same way that great dialogue often reveals emotion, character, and information to propel the story forward. That's hard for us to <mw correct="gauge" type="trans" mv="no">guage</mw> of course, and for me, I know it's one of my hardest tasks as a writer to <mw correct="gauge" type="trans" mv="no">guage</mw> where I've added too much. Narrative can be a writer's quicksand. To avoid lulling the reader out of the story, we need to make sure that our narrative is never plain vanilla. We invoke strong images and precise verbs to make it count and make it compelling, and that leads to the risk of writerly indulgence. Narrative is most often where we fall in love with our words. Hopefully, our transitions are smooth enough that we take the reader along for the ride until we get right back into the next, necessary,¬†scene.</s>

So when I'd smile for the picture, my cheek muscles would <mw correct="visibly" type="sub" mv="no">visably</mw> freak out. As a result, I formed a habit of not smiling in pictures, especially when I'm tired. My eyelid also twitches when I'm tired, as do my calf muscles.</s>

		<s sv="no">My least favorite stories were (surprisingly) Dorothy Allison's, which wasn't just about one friend, but various friends and lovers, and didn't have the type of focus I was looking for in this anthology, though it had some beautiful writing - Patricia Marx's, which was too short and too vague, too much like an outline of a friendship without the characters and details - and, I'm sort of <mw correct="embarrassed" type="delrep" mv="no">embarassed</mw> to say, but Jennifer Gilmore's "The Kindness of Strangers" was very hard for me to read. It's about Jennifer as a twenty-something who has to have her colon removed, and her rancorous and jealous thoughts. I'm sure the story was therapuetic for Gilmore to write, but after reading about how miserable her life was, I was hoping for some sort of redemption. Even a cheesy epilog would have helped.  Because each of these stories has such a sad ending (except for Nuar Alsadir, whose "friend" really needed to get lost), and Gilmore's illness was so grueling, I felt like the anthology needed to end on a somewhat happy note.</s>
		<s sv="no">My favorite character in the movie was The Kid. He was awesome. Impeccably dressed, humorous, and a helpful sidekick. Think suspenders, knickers and newsboy caps all in the same deliciously bold colors seen in the clip above. I'd post some pictures here, but it seems that despite the movies fabulous visuals, which is really it's strongpoint, there <mw correct="aren't" type="del" mv="no">arn't</mw> too many pictures or even video to be found. But, it appears you can find some of the old Dick Tracy series on youtube.</s>
		<s sv="no">Now there was the curious study in 2007¬†by¬†Professor Manuel Garzon of Spain's Granada University, which found people¬†that beer had a slightly better hydration effect¬†after exercise than water,¬†which <mw correct="exercise" type="ins" mv="no">excercise</mw> psysiologists immediately called into question, given¬†the¬†diuretic effect of alcohol.¬† Dave Munger in his blog Science Based Running could not find any peer reviewed article by Garzon on the subject, suggesting that¬†Garzon's findings did not pass scientific scrutiny.¬†¬†¬†But Munger¬†did find a scientific article from 1997¬†which found that drinks containing 2% or less percent alcohol had no significant diuretic effect on recovery, while there was a slight negative¬†effect on re-hydration on drinks containing 4% alcohol.¬†¬† Virtually all beers, with the exception of low alcohol beers, contain more than 4% alcohol. Lagers, pilsners, Kolschs¬†and other "lawn mower" thirst quenching beers typically check in at about 5% alcohol per volume.</s>
		<s sv="no">Again, I highly recommend reading this article, especially since most of the people who we seek advice from about graduate school tend to err on the positive side of things. In terms of the article, that graduate students are a source of cheap labor becomes apparent in the first semesters of graduate school. I must have taught smallish sections of undergraduates for 10 semesters during my graduate years (e.g., grading exams, serving as a <mw correct="liaison" type="delphon" mv="no">liason</mw> between students and professors). Graduate students do this work to cover tuition costs and for a small stipend. I could have used a little extra money during graduate school.</s>

The fact that we have a fabulous line-up of about 80 guests along with our 100 members is at the same time wonderful, and yet daunting. I'm not going to name them, because that would be tacky and I'm not tacky, but I will say that if you had told me during my years of dismal failure to get published, that one day I would chair an AGM at which Margaret Drabble would be a guest, I would have said you were delusional.

		<s sv="no">Then there are the <mw correct="occasional" type="insrep" mv="no">occassional</mw> NYTBR reviews that I just don't know what to make of. Troy Patterson (another television critic) reveiwed Mark Danielewski's new book, Only Revolutions, in yesterday's review. It should be said that Danielewski is not your average American novelist. He has been compared to Thomas Pynchon and Jacques Derrida - his novels are considered "modernist" or "postermodernist". While I would think he's trying to do more than tell a story, I don't think his inventive structure is designed as "a trap to catch reviewers," as Patterson figures. Right. Danielewski spent six years writing this novel to "catch reviewers." Only a paragraph above Patterson mentions that Only Revolutions has been nominated for the National Book Award.</s>

		<s sv="no">There are some debates that seem to have been going from the first time I was aware of contemporary poetry. Where are the black and Asian poets, I wonder? whenever I see a grouping of young poets they seem absent - has marginalisation re-occurred? Or has the relative success of the "performance" poem created its own separate world? Possibly the same goes for explicitly gay and lesbian poets? Then again, the British and Irish poem of the <mw correct="millennial" type="delrep" mv="no">millenial</mw> window seems primarily concerned with self, but not in a confessional way, more in the anecdotal or the observational. In a globalised world, one sees poetry that is often as narrow as Larkin's or Heaney's - the flipside being that the narrowness is a trick, that the poem's universality can be found in the localism of subject, as it can be in the poetry of a recluse from Amherst. In terms of form, a certain formal free verse has been de rigeur for so long now, that one is almost surprised when something tighter or looser strays into the pages of "Poetry Review." Then again, now is the first time - in the UK at least - we're seeing poets who have consistently been through the workshopping of the BA or MA programs - often run by that previous generation's poets; a process that started a decade or so earlier with MA fiction courses. </s>

Just what is in the UK water that they've managed to have the most liberal lefties in power over the last few decades, happily destroying their country? Remember¬†Margaret¬†Thatcher? How could a country go from such a powerful woman politician to the anaemic lot that have since graced 10 Downing Street? And just where are their cojones? Do they leave them behind when they graduate from their Private Schools? The UK today is scared of its own shadow. ¬†Gone are the days when they invaded countries with their fearsome navy. Gone are the days when they commanded respect around the world. Today they are a shell of their old self. Not that I'm complaining.

This article is all about how David Cameron wanting to destroy the institution of marriage by allowing Gays to wed. It's the current fad of the Western countries, where every government is trying to outdo each other to kill off their stable society. It's like global warming. All the European countries scrambled to destroy their economies by bringing in 'green power'.

So, now Gay marriage is the next little 'have to have' item. Just when the heck are governments going to deal with the real issues - like excessive low-skilled immigration, health, education, safety? That's what people want - for them to stick with the basics. Instead they poke around with Gay marriage and green energy and PC indoctrination of the youth. Leave marriage ALONE. It's an institution that brings stability and prosperity to families, and children turn out well-balanced and cared for. But no, that's not what the Left want. The sooner they can destroy the family unit and weaken their population the better. A weaker, dysfunctional society is easier to control.....</s>

		<s sv="no">Ok, here's the back story. None of the bedrooms in our house are hard-wired for light fixtures. No recessed cans, track-lights, or chandeliers. Boo. So, we've been forced to use the ever-heinous torchiere lamps from fancy places like Target &amp; Home Depot. Eventually, down the road, I would love love love to have the rooms properly lit. Until then, we'll make it work. Well, I've seen some awesome people making awesome light-fixtures using thrift store lamp shades lately. Give it a try??? Sure, why not!? Well........NOT. Ha ha. Ok, let me clarify. I got a lamp shade at a local thrift shop for $1.50. It was a brand new shade with the plastic wrap still on it. I ripped all the fabric off to expose the frame, and ended up spray painting it pink. BUT, because this was a new shade that was fairly good quality, the glue that held the fabric on was lumpy and definitely noticeable. So, being the freaking genius that I am (enter sarcastic tone here), I decided to wrap the thing in yarn. yes, yarn. Remember how much I loved making yarn wreaths??! Well, this was a yarn wreath on steroids! So tedious and aggravating I can not tell you. I do not recommend it. Anyway, once it was wrapped in yarn, I wanted to fancy it up somehow. Crystals??

Unfortunately, although it is possible to visit the building today, you will need an official invitation to enter if you are not a member of the local Jewish community.

Every video uploaded - for instance - requires skills, with a camera, with a computer, that though "simple" aren't to be dismissed. Faced with this abundance, this longest, flattest of tails, there's a real risk that outside careful niches, art - this semi-professional art - falls silently. We all know of cult artists who did something a long time before the mainstream; we may be doing it ourselves; yet the contemporary critical culture is so linked to the marketing machine; so linked to the economic case for art (for instance, ALL the 6 "shortlisted" for the Ted Hughes prize this year are "commissions" - 4 of them for the BBC - surely, automatically excluding new, younger or less established poets?) In other words, just a few years after saying that the internet would democratize, hear we have more examples of how "gatekeepers" are back in a very clear way. If we've long wondered about the Turner Prize shortlist, for instance, it's partly because it's criteria is a professionals' one. Although I regularly go to contemporary art I don't think I've ever gone to Turner-shortlisted show. I don't even know if there has ever been a Manchester one that has been shortlisted?

		<s sv="no">What really prompted this was the number of interviews I seem to have had back-to-back lately where parents (especially first-time parents) seem to be so high and mighty about so many things concerning hiring a new nanny.  I realize that your first priority as a parent is to protect your child, and I respect certain questions I am asked.  I think good parents SHOULD ask a number of questions about someone they are considering to take care of their children.  But I had an interview with a couple recently who had a newborn (their first) and GRILLED me on infant care and the do's and don't's past the point of what I felt was normal.  They seemed extremely condescending and actually even handed me a "quiz" they had printed out on baby care.  They then informed me that if I took the job, I should know now that I would be recorded on cameras all <mw correct="throughout" type="del" mv="no">througout</mw> the house at all times that they could look in on while they were at work. In theory, I get this. However, even though I have nothing to hide, this makes me uncomfortable for obvious reasons.  What if I have a personal phone call I need to take, or make? How do I know these cameras aren't included in the bathroom? What if I need to change clothes for some reason, is there a safe room to do so? Etc...  but also the camera thing bothered me because you either trust me or you don't.  If you're such an expert on children and babies just because you recently gave birth to one, but haven't worked in child care for 17 years like I have, and if you're so paranoid that someone does it right, then WHY on earth are you leaving them with someone else?  You're sitting here interviewing a nanny to care for your child for 10 to 12 hours a day because you don't want to do it, yet you act as if I'm stupid and don't know anything because I haven't given birth to a child and I'm not a mother. So you're willing to leave your baby with this person who you don't really trust, and then watch videos after the fact to see if anything bad happened?? Basically what you're doing is testing the situation out on your child if you really don't trust the person you're leaving them with in the first place.</s>
		<s sv="no">Some other things have bothered me in jobs off and on and in interviews that I think parents can't see the nanny's perspective on, and maybe if you tried to, your nanny wouldn't get overwhelmed or burned out so easily. Kids are great, amazing, and fun, but also very draining and tiring at times.  Especially in certain jobs where there might be a heavy schedule to adhere to, activities to get to, or extra chores for the nanny to do besides watching and working with the children.  We sometimes feel the same as a stressed-out mom, and that is understandable for mothers, yet nannies are expected to be "on" at ALL times, and perfect in everything they do, and always high-energy, fun, and engaging.  I feel like about 90% of parents that hire nannies expect them to never sit down and take a break, make a phone call, check their texts, be in the bathroom for any length of time, sit down and enjoy lunch, read a book they brought or GOD-FORBID watch TV. *gasp*  The TV thing is getting <mw correct="ridiculous" type="subphon" mv="no">rediculous</mw> in jobs I've had.  I am NOT one to sit down, watch tv and ignore the kids.  And I'm not even talking about watching TV for myself but when COUNTLESS parents over and over and over and over that I've worked for, or interviewed for stress so much that they don't want their kids watching TV, but yet the kids tell me that's all they do in the evenings or on the weekends, or when I come each morning to get them ready for school with JUST enough time to do so, and all morning they've been in front of the TV while their parents are getting themselves ready, it gets irritating.</s>

		<s sv="no">Three days left in Bali and by now it leaves me with a smile driving through the city streets. I have accustomed well and got myself a scooter. Amazing how being mobil has changed my experience here. I am no longer being hazzeled by the never ending ‚Äì transport or taxi ‚Äì call outs when walking on the sidewalk, or what they call sidewalk but actually is more like an obsticale course and made me always nervous to catch my flip flop or worse my whole foot in the concrete cracks. The walk into the town of Ubud in total was never enjoyable and I felt irritable by the time we get anywhere. Not wanting to stay in this energetic at any time while being here I did what worked for me and got myself some wheels. I don‚Äôt feel quiet like a local yet driving as there are no traffic rules and I still have to concentrate so much that I am sure I am a funny sight to watch, all serious under my way too big half shelf helmet. I realize there are still parts of town I have not explored and so it is my mission to do so in the remainder time. The people are lovely here ‚Äì so friendly so peaceful and can I just say what I enjoy so much as well , there is no stealing here. You know how nice it is to just put your helmet on top of the mirror at your bike and not have to worry. I see people leaving there entire groceries behind. Wouldn‚Äôt that be nice to go back to these days where one would think that a stinking helmet is not something anyone could desire. I have spent two days on the gilli T island as the white people called it in slang. The proper name is Gili Tranwangan, the largest of the three Gili islands belonging to Lombok. Gili T is said to be the party island and I contest to the truth of that matter. I was not there for the party but rather it is the easiest island to get to and honestly I was dying to get away a bit from all the couples. I knew Bali was honeymoon destination number one and I get why but traveling as a single I found myself annoyed by looking at all the happy couples. (We did see some unhappy ones, too. I‚Äôde say I give them at least two more years before their relationship will end in inreconsilable differences.) I did find what I was looking for on the island: Cristal clear water, white sand beach and sun. Once you leave the party scene behind on one street you can actually find beaches all around the island that are deserted, only me, endlessly screening my eyes over the aboundance of shells and coral peaces carpeting the entire stretch of beach. And so I splourged spending two nights in a geourgeos bungalow, all dark wood with the large white bed, dancing white sheer courtains all around for moskito protection. Yes, it, too, was the perfect honeymoon room, but this I didn‚Äôt mind, to stretch my legs in all directions, fully enjoying my room, my time, my bed, The place had front beach access and all lawn chairs reserved for little me. One of the owners was German, post or present hippie, usually living in Berlin, when not in Bali. We had a beer and chatted. You can appreciate that even the most hippiest looking person coming from Germany atually has had a most qualified education, including University and therefore the conversations with Martin were interesting, lasting and wordly. We set front row, watching all the white people walking by on their way to the next <mw correct="cocktail" type="del" mv="no">coctail</mw> party and every once in a while a local would greet Martin, saying something in Indonesian, a language which I in the one month did not pick up at all, not even the hello and thank you. I don‚Äôt know, but this language does not stick with me at all. Oh well. Gilli T is entrily taken over by tourism, there is no doubt about that. Water shortage and trash mountains are creating a huge problem and for me a personal conflict for being there. I asked Martin all sorts of questions as I was worried about the additional water plastic bottle I just consumed and personally curious where the water came from, provided in the outdoor shower for me. Martin shared all the concerns this island is going to face with the ever increasing tourism on the island and the very little solutions for the problems. I am afraid there weren‚Äôt too many concerned visitors and I want to perhaps simply blame that on the age range of all the travelers there. 99% of all people coming to Gilli T are young hipsters, surfers from all over the world, age range 18 ‚Äì 24, I guessed. And for them I have to say it truly is heaven. If I had a daughter or son that age I would absolutely support them to come here. Its safe haven, beach time, fun as fun happens at that age and also perhaps a fun way to be introduced to your first mushroom experience.</s>

We had to queue for a while, during which time we were entertained and educated by a very entertaining and informative Monsieur. The Regard de la Lanterne is where three channels of water from the nappe feed into a small basin which in turn feeds the aqueduct of Belleville - the principal channel in the system. Again, the function of this building was nothing more than to allow for inspection of the waters and channels. As our guide drily emphasised, if such a system was built today, then nothing more than a 50mm pipe would carry the water, with a small box for inspection, all hidden away.

You think about dogs from the second you wake up in the morning, until you can finally close your eyes to sleep at night, IF you have time to sleep. Serious!  The compassion fatigue is killer.  It doesn't hit you like a ton of bricks, but it will catch up with you.  It makes you tired, it makes you depressed, it makes you old.  What saves your life, time after time is the next save!  The next dog you saved from that lethal needle or other end.  You make people happy, because you can give them what they want!

When I was pitched for this book, I saw an image of the books cover, and gladly accepted. I expected the book to be about as thick as a magazine, so I was really surprised when the book showed up and was twice as thick as I was expecting. This book has so many awesome origami pieces that can be made! ¬†There‚Äôs so many ideas, that even non-artistic people are likely to find a few projects in here that interest them. Who knew you could make a ring out of paper? Some ideas in the book are even educationally based and could be used in high school science classes, like a DNA strand. Some designs are very detailed, and would be really hard to make if using a small piece of paper. Others are much more basic and could be made by tweens. I think origami is neat, but my only real experience with it so far had been an origami¬†<mw correct="calendar" type="subphon" mv="no">calender</mw>¬†I bought. It was suppose to be 365 different origami designs, one for each day of the year. However, almost every idea in the¬†<mw correct="calendar" type="subphon" mv="no">calender</mw>¬†was an animal of some sort, and I quickly realized that almost all of the designs were extremely similar. The dogs, cats, fox, horse, etc were all almost identical. I was afraid that might be the case with this book, but it‚Äôs not at all. There is an animal section, but all of the animals are unique. However, the animal portion is just one small section of¬†the¬†book, there are several other sections like flowers, geometric, people, and my personal favorite ‚Äì practical.

Eventually it became large enough that entertainers such as bands were introduced into the festivites. For the 1933 celebration Elanor Roosevelt was first lady and introduced more games. The modern day easter egg roll race of today (using spoons) wasn't started until 1974. At one time there was a circus, petting zoo, antique cars on display, Broadway shows and giant balloons (most likely air balloons) as part of the entertainment.

They had these fake lemon trees covering the ceiling everywhere so it felt like we were eating in a lemon grove.  The food!  Oh!  The food!  They pride themselves on using local produce and only vine ripened tomatoes.  I don't know how they did it but they were fabulous.

They served these fantastic rolls- some were a honey white, honey wheat, pesto and sundried <mw correct="tomato" type="ins" mv="no">tomatoe</mw>.  Our table literally ate three bowls of them.

It was served on a slice of potatoes au-gratin but these are NOT your mother's au-gratin potatoes.  I think they had marsapone cheese.  They were so good.  There was also some fantastic pan fried butternut squash.  On our way out we decided to visit the little sweet shop they had in the restaurant.  They sell those fabulous rolls and everything in the dessert display was 50% off so we got two slices of turtle cheesecake to share with my sister in law and brother in law.

Very cute~</s>
		<s sv="no">The  eyeshadow <mw correct="palette" type="insrep,delrep" mv="no">pallete</mw> comes with 5 different eyeshadows which can be  interchangeably used to create a variety of looks. Despite the darker  shades in this collection, you can still opt for a more natural and  less-is-more look by just using the pearly light blue highlight shade  with the lilac shade, followed by one of the darker shades to line your  lash line. I opted for a smokey eye using all 5 of the shades..</s>
		<s sv="no">The  look, overall, looks quite purple-y and this may just be due to the  lighting. However, the different shades blend together quite well and  I'm curious to see what other looks I can create with this <mw correct="palette" type="insrep,delrep" mv="no">pallete</mw>. The  downside of this <mw correct="palette" type="insrep,delrep" mv="no">pallete</mw> is that I was expecting it to be a little bit  more pigmented and possibly even more sparkly. When you first look at  the <mw correct="palette" type="insrep,delrep" mv="no">pallete</mw>, the surface of the shadows are very shimmery, but after you  start using them and remove the top layer, you realise it's actually a  bit more matte.

		<s sv="no">On a more positive note, the black shadow (in the  middle) in this <mw correct="palette" type="insrep,delrep" mv="no">pallete</mw> is REALLY black. I love it! All the other black  shadows I have aren't pigmented enough and I end up having to layer it a  bit to get that intense dark look. I wasn't anticipating how  concentrated the colour was going to be when I loaded up my brush and  then I touched my lid with it and BAM! Hahah had to crazy blend so avoid  harsh edges hahaha!!</s>
		<s sv="no">The dark/medium grey shade is a bit meh  to me. Didn't use a whole lot of it in my look and wasn't a huge fan of  it. That's my personal preference though. The navy shade is probably my  favourite next to the black shade~ it's like a beautiful twilight blue *sodreamy*.  Blending it with some of the other shades made it so pretty and there  was an iridescent quality I really loved. The pearly light blue  highlight shade is quite good but I wish it were a bit more pigmented. I  was tempted to use a highlightng eyeshadow from another <mw correct="palette" type="insrep,delrep" mv="no">pallete</mw> to  apply to my inner corners and brow bone because I just wasn't feeling¬†  it from this pearly light blue!

		<s sv="no">I will pass on the issue of whether W.C. is a good city manager or not. What disturbs me most about this situation is: (1) How poorly Funk handled it with his unilateral action, but then (2) how poorly the 9 council members responded with their own equally unilateral action. The 9 wish to claim that they were only responding to Funk's lack of inclusiveness (and rightfully so at first), but then they themselves respond with an equally non-inclusive action by ramrodding a 3.5 year contract down the taxpayers throat with NO, and I mean NO, notice or discussion. We voted for these people, and they left us (and the other council members) out of the loop as well. I for one would have like to have known what they were doing before it was done. This was bad government, and bad politicians, at their worst. At that point, the gang of 9 lost any credibilty to claim the moral high ground that they were only responding to, and thus trying to fix, Funk's lack of inclusiveness. This is clearly just a "show" argument without real substance. Clearly, this was nothing more than a power play by BOTH sides to get what they want. Saddly, in this power play the real losers are the citizens of this city that have to watch 13 adults behave like spoiled children. I have lived in this city for <mw correct="almost" type="trans" mv="no">alomst</mw> 45 years, and I have NEVER been this disgusted with a council before. ALL of them are merely advancing their own agendas at our expense.I have watched the hearing twice and I am very disappointed in many of the people I personally supported with both money and time. However, I am most disappointed in two people: Cathy Jolly and Beth Gottstein (Jan a close third). Each ran on a platform of cooperation and advancing the agenda of the people/city over thier own. They showed their colors by joining into the fray and adding their voices to the cacophany of anger and hate. These two women know better, they just chose to pursue their own agendas over what was right: Attempting to work a resolution of the matter before embarassing this entire city with their conduct and chaos.As Shakespeare wrote, "A pox on all your houses," and truer words were never written about this council. This ENTIRE council should be ashamed and <mw correct="embarrassed" type="delrep" mv="no">embarassed</mw> about how they are behaving. If they are not, then Lord knows I am <mw correct="embarrassed" type="delrep" mv="no">embarassed</mw> enough by them for all of us. I have to spend this Christmas explaining once again to my in-laws in Kansas why I and my husband still live in KC. My residency has just become much harder to defend. I am sad tonight for my city, and that this is my city council.Beth, Cathy, Jan, Cindy and Ed, please grow up over Christmas, because right now you are killing us.</s>

However, this is unlike a stage production, where the baby would be represented by a doll, or perhaps a flashlight beaming upward from the base of a crib. Guy uses a real baby, probably a boy about one year old, squirming, bouncing and waving his arms before his subjects, just like any kid that age would do.

		<s sv="no">Is this shift to the east necessarily a bad thing? Well to the conspiracy theorists they'd be rid of the Free Masons and the zionists and the Jews, etc, so to them its a good move. To them Gaddafi was a hero and rightfully so, because from the perspective of the conspiracy theorists, being part of the west it makes sense that they should cheer Gaddafi for having pioneered the onslaught and resistance to the NWO. Unfortunately while supporting the Muslim Nazi's they do not realise that the one evil is being replaced with another evil. While the NWO may have big plans and may strive towards total control they do not control the east, whether they want to believe it or not. The east has its own agenda and that agenda has been working so effectively that the NWO and the west lost the plot completely. Today everything you buy in the west is made in the east, the economies of the west are wholly dependent upon the east. The car manufacturers of the west are sinking, because the east have flood the market with good and <mw correct="cheap" type="subphon" mv="no">cheep</mw> rubbish, killing the west's vehicle manufacturing industry, for but a few still standing. Italy is sinking because their markets have been flooded by better, cheaper vehicles from the east.

Soon I needed to refill the bottles and luckily I saw this large nursery kind of place with women with their heads covered by hats and cloths over their napes watering saplings in pots. As I stopped and walked the cycle to the gate they looked extremely wary and this young guy shouted back a no almost before I could finish my neer sikta? Can I get some water? But then they registered what I was saying and said yes. I passed by this little shed that had a few bottles kept under coconut fronds, but I obviously didn‚Äôt want to eat into their cache. The young guy unscrewed the shower head off his hose and I filled out my bottles. Kudiyuve neeru? Drinking water? I asked half-heartedly and believed him when he said yes.

By now I‚Äôd had a lot of water and my stomach felt full, but I needed to eat something so I asked someone where I could get something to eat and found a little chai place again.

The show also features PKD audio recordings including his dictated notes on a planned sequel to 'The Man in the High Castle' made while Dick's arm was in a sling recovering from shoulder surgery.

		<s sv="no">Of course we have Gerhard Richter doing it, but his is more of a nihilist painting parlor trick about flattening everything out along with photography and there by destroying all meaning of anything.  There is also the ironic form of abstraction.  In his discussion with Rebecca Morris, Hamza Walker touched on the key points of ‚ÄúAbstraction becoming a platform to critique painting...abstract painting becoming allegory, trope, to critique modernity.‚Äù  This is the official justification of the strain of painting which stems from Richter and moves down through Luc Tuymans and Wilhelm Sasnal and Magnus von Plessen.  That, alongside the more loosely rigorous likes of Martin Kippenberger, Peter Doig and Daniel Richter account for the accepted modes of painting.  Even a relative new comer like Thomas Scheibitz, who seems more on the non representational kick, still has representation.  It seems very few artists working in the once again acceptable realm of painting are doing abstraction.  And doing it with total <mw correct="commitment" type="insrep" mv="no">committment</mw>.  The total commitment of the painting of yore; the painting of Pollock and deKooning, the last painting that can ever be painted of Ad Reinhardt, that is serious business.  That sort of painting is digging up old corpses many would rather leave buried in museums.  That painting is endgame painting, painting the task of mourning painting, painting like it‚Äôs the last night on earth painting.  THAT is Abstraction.  That is Abstract with an ‚ÄúA‚Äù and Painting with a  ‚ÄúP.‚Äù  It is, as Hamza Walker read aloud, ‚ÄúAbstraction as a gauntlet, as a challenge, a dare.  Who has the courage to paint for paintings sake?  A painting for pleasure‚Äôs sake?  Paintings that expose it as reading or thinking in its own right?‚Äù</s>
		<s sv="no">It is not to center Morris at the heart of a heated debate, full of theory and fury.  Or to place Morris as the figure head of a return to serious abstraction.  But it is in viewing the work, and later contemplating and discussing it, that these issues arise.  There is no set conclusion, or finality.  Art is never meant as a definitive answer.  Theory is opinion.  Art criticism, at its best is discussion and progression towards ever changing goals.  At its worse it is either dictated like the Ten Commandments in an impenetrable language, or is hopelessly <mw correct="lacklustre" type="trans" mv="no">lackluster</mw> and flaccid in it‚Äôs criteria-less reportage description.

		<s sv="no">We got a nice sneak peak at the opening of the previous show (Robert Amft, which was also excellent).  Bergman has been working for a while and has two modes of painting that have clashed in this show.  One is a dada meats Agnes Martin style where she acquires <mw correct="abandoned" type="subphon" mv="no">abondoned</mw> paintings at thrifts stores and turns them into faces.  But the process of living with them, sometimes for years, and waiting for a moment of clarity is in touch with poetic Minimalism.  When the image reveals itself a few deft brushtrokes bring it out.  The other style is wild and crazy.  Loose and violent, but also lighthearted and funny.  These paintings come out of nowhere, but click right-on with a lot of what is going on in contemporary art.</s>

		<s sv="no">Stout - (my fave) - I described it in last week's beer post, but boiled down, this is a very very dark beer, that makes someone think about something rich, like coffee or toffee or chocolate. It isn't sweet like fruit beers can be, it can feel almost dry when compared to light colored beers. The main flavor of a stout comes from roasted barley. Carbonation is usually minimal in stouts, which is why they are usually put on a nitro tap in bars. The nitro <mw correct="system" type="del" mv="no">sytem</mw> is what is responsible for that creamy, masking effect that makes pouring a Guinness so fun to watch. The big 3 are Murphy's, Guinness and Beamish.</s>
		<s sv="no">Oatmeal Stout - A variation of the traditional stout, this came about when people thought that adding oats to the brewing mix would make the beer healthier. The side bonus is that oatmeal stouts tend to be a <mw correct="little" type="delrep" mv="no">litle</mw> sweeter than traditional stouts. What you get is a very silky-smooth beer that has a BIG taste, but doesn't feel like you should have to chew it.</s>

The internal Lebanese conflict: Since its inception as a nation-state, Lebanon has consistently been plagued by sectarian violence, as the seventeen-odd communities within it vie for autonomy and autocracy. Despite the greatest hopes of the international community, the Lebanese government has historically failed to meet one certain expectation: the ability to wield centralized control of the country and to <mw correct="implement" type="subphon" mv="no">impliment</mw> policy. In the fifties, Christians and Muslims bloodied each other in the streets. In the seventies, with the addition of the Palestinian factor (most importantly, the P.L.O. - for more, click here), Lebanon dissolved into clannish factions each with its own armed militia and each providing its community with largely autonomous public works. Following the Israeli invasion of 1982, and the assassination of Bashar Gemayel, the government of Beirut was effectively held hostage by it's larger neighbour, Syria.</s>

I saw her through the doorway in a crowd of relatives, and I knew instantly that - well, that was it. Her smile opened my heavens and her eyes - well they danced with the lightness of a rising heat. We headed to the car and wound our way slowly to a beach, sand and ocean, shade and light. When we slid from the car after that relaxing drive, we had a melting moment. We held each other for the very first time - and remain in that embrace today. I remember we were exactly the same height and her hair smelt of ripe peaches.

So, at first we were pretty set on seeing how we could sabotage the relationship (if you can even call it that)....  We thought for sure that once the kid got a good look at who her parents were--and the crazeeness it entailed--this thing would be short-lived.  Well, come to find out--he must be just as crazee as we are--because it's been two weeks now (which is like forever in early teen boyfriend/girlfriend world)--and no such luck in the sabotage department.  In all seriousness though--it has been an adjustment ...but we were glad to discover that having a boyfriend at 13, mostly just means:  sitting by each other at lunch, hanging out at after school functions, and the <mw correct="occasional" type="insrep" mv="no">occassional</mw> holding of hands.  Which, we can live with--  we decided that if we make a BIG deal out of something that isn't really a big deal--we'll force our kid to hide even BIGGER deals from us.

		<s sv="no">Another classic early 70s album from Marcos Valle,  But, this album took a little while to grow on me.  Perhaps because, when I'm obsessively-compulsively collecting, consuming, and divulging music, I am busy worshiping the Dark One, Satan√°is, Beelzebub, Lucifer, or Jimmy Witherspoon - I am a little put off by the opening track on this one, 'Jesus Meu Rei.'  On the other hand, there is an apocryphal and even millenarian streak to a lot of the content on this album.   Satan may have granted me the power to acquire gluttunous amounts of music over the years, but far be if from me to question The Brothers Valle if their faith is strong.  It's a gorgeous baroque pop tune with whispy harpsichord and strummy acoustic guitar and very, um, "churchy" organ from none other than Dom Salvador.  Then tuning into the lyrics and I am surprised, in spite of knowing that I shouldn't be, of Paulo S√©rgios genius.  In its hymnal piety the song also calls on Jesus to look around at how the world has changed, and ambiguous lines that can either be a lament of world gone down the wrong path, or perhaps a plea to some type of moral relativity <mw correct="and" type="trans" mv="no">adn</mw> realism ("nada e ninguem / sabe o que √© mal / e o que √© bem / Jesus meu rei / fazendo lei / Passa seu tempo real").

Listen to how well the lyrics, vocals, and <mw correct="arrangements" type="del" mv="no">arrangments</mw> hang together and reinforce each other.</s>
		<s sv="no">"Com mais de trinta" begins by playing with the trendy phrase of the late 60s and early 70s, "Never trust anyone over 30," after which Paulo gives us a hold LOT of reasons not to trust the number 30.  Then seemingly leaving the whole idea of 30 in the dust as the narrator contemplates the things in life he dreams about but never does, his sensation of dislocation in time and space, "Passo a passo, fa√ßo mais um tra√ßo".. This is deceptively simple, unadorned lyricism.  Bereft of the layered complexity of Chico Buarque's genius work, or unburdened by the density of Caetano Veloso's beguiling forays into solipsism, Paulo S√©rgio seems to have had a way of saying speaking in a very simple way about very complex ideas.  So simply and directly that might leave you utterly unstruck and unconcinved when first encountered.  There is a clean <mw correct="symmetrical" type="delrep" mv="no">symetrical</mw> beauty to the words, Marcos' vocal delivery, and the production and arrangements.  When the truth of this hit me, the parts of this album that had seemed like a bit of a confused mess became utterly uncluttered.   Paulo had a way of setting words to Marcos' musical ideas that makes them one of the classic telekinetic songwriting teams.  And Paulo had a way of churning out pointed, sardonic, and nuanced critiques of all manner of societal patterns, preconceptions, of issues contemporary and contextual and quasi-eternal, without ever succumbing to bitterness or hipster irony,  holding on to his own brand of humanist optimism.</s>
		<s sv="no">"Cafona" (translated roughly as in bad taste, tacky, 'brega' or whatever) is either utter nonsense or deep and profound.  I'm not sure.

And it was the lead track for a another telenovela <mw correct="soundtrack" type="del" mv="no">sountrack</mw>, a show with the same name of "Cafona."

		<s sv="no">Over the years the Balch and Burroughs films have been released on home video in various incarnations. In 1984, Towers Open Fire and Ghosts at No. 9 were released on the 2nd tape of double-VHS release of the Burroughs-themed The Final Academy Documents, while all 5 films were made available in 1988 on the UK Jettisoundz/Visionary label as Thee Films 1950s - 1960s (which the Cherry Red DVD is a re-issue of), while in the US, Mystic Fire Video released the films  (minus Ghosts at No. 9 (Paris)) on a tape simply entitled Towers Open Fire. In 2005, both Towers Open Fire and The Cut-Ups were included as extras on Synapses' DVD edition of Balch's Secrets of Sex (or Bizarre as it's known Stateside), also included on UK label Odean's 2010 DVD. Italian label issued a 2-disc collection of Burroughs films under the title W.S. Burroughs: The Cut-Up Films, which included the 5 films plus two additional films, Stan Brakhage's 1978 film Thot Fal‚ÄôN (which Burroughs appears in) and Commissioner of Sewers, a shot on video <mw correct="souvenir" type="ins" mv="no">souvenier</mw> of Burroughs' trip to Germany in 1986. The Raro DVD would seem an obvious choice but apparently the picture quality is quite poor. The region-free Cherry Red DVD is by far the best way to see these films, the image quality looks very good (in as much as it could be), although the Cherry Red DVD provides no information on the films, and lazily replicates the Jettisoundz/Visionary edition's misleading title (none of the films were made in the 1950's) and it's lack of credit for Antony Balch, the co-creative force behind these important films. Aside from some promos for other Cherry Red releases (including their poor release of The Final Academy), the disc has no extras.</s>

		<s sv="no">Perhaps as time continues onward, the urge to experience feelings of fatalism, gloom, and/or melancholy do not seem so inappropriate or misplaced. Whether or not you agree with the alarmist proclamations of environmentalists, radical politicians, ministers, and 'culture advocates', there is no denying the inevitable fact that every living organism has a finite time of existence. This fragile existence is increasingly threatened by the outside environment, not only through the actions of other humans (malevolent or otherwise) but through environmental factors and statistical probability as well. In such troubled times, the need for a musical expression of this collective sadness is not only logical, but essential and even welcomed in some respects. Thus, in the same manner that Ulver's "Shadows Of The Sun" portrayed a somber portrait of loss and longing (while using different techniques, of course), "No Lights In Our Eyes" explores themes of death, dying, and the underlying thoughts which line our subconsciousness, and how we react to such <mw correct="occurrences" type="subphon" mv="no">occurances</mw>.</s>

I say this because we know shockingly little about Shakespeare's life for certain. In fact we can't even be sure what he looked like or even how best to spell his name! Bryson is perfectly honest and open about this from right at the beginning of the book. In fact many stories stated as fact in other books are often only legends with no evidence whatsoever to back them up.

		<s sv="no">We have reason to believe that Albany Ale was parti-gyled. For those of you uninitiated in the ways of historic brewing, parti-gyling is a blending of worts to achieve a certain gravity. Basically, a single batch of grain is mashed, sparged and its running are collected, usually two to three times. Each subsequent running has a lower gravity than the previous one. The runnings are then boiled and hopped, separately, the worts are then brought back together in different ratios allowing the brewer to adjust the gravity of the now combined wort. Adding a little of the weakest wort to the strongest will mellow it out, while adding a little of the strongest to the weakest will strengthen that beer.¬†It's all about brewing <mw correct="efficiency" type="subphon" mv="no">efficency</mw>. Brewers could make at least two, sometimes three or four strong beers (plus a little small beer) without having to actually brew that many times.¬†There are a variety of ways to do this, but this is the general idea.

		<s sv="no">As for the Peterfruend comment.  There's no argument with anything you've said.  However, the tenacity it takes for any writer to simply get a short story published is beyond belief for most people (sometimes is simply comes down to luck). Just last month I sold a short story to Cleis Press, and the editor sent me a revision.  He didn't just "tighten and edit";  he changed content to the point where the story lost all of my voice.  In that case I turned down the contract.  But, later that week, I sold the same story to a competitor who didn't change a word. And, though sad, most shouldn't be trying to do it in the first place.  Between writing and reviewing blogs, I also have a small editorial <mw correct="service" type="trans" mv="no">serivce</mw>, Rainbow Editorial.  I follow canon eithics, always remain objective and refuse to write query letters or do submissions for payment.  Just editing.  And most of those whom I edit are only fooling themselves, yet they, too, believe their work is the best...to the point where I've actually seen some turn down publishers because they believed the contract wasn't fair.  When in reality they should have jumped at the chance for anyone to publish them.  I also review web sites and blogs...most of which are awful, self-indulgent pages filled with limited talent at best.  You happen to be a good writer, who has found a niche...most aren't that fortunate.</s>

My doberman Blitz suffered from cancer, beat it once, but not the second time around when he was much older.

It was <mw correct="extremely" type="del" mv="no">extemely</mw> painful to take him to the vet, we even postponed his euth twice. I still feel so guilty, and I think I always will, that I could not do it. My mother took him in. And it kills me to the date, that as he walked away from our home, with his limping and all, he wagged his tail because he was 'going for a car ride'. And I wasn't there. And my mother came back home without him, and in tears with his collar and leash in hand. And it hurts me. And I feel like a bad person. But my mother soothes that feeling when she reminds me of the many places Blitz went with me, of the many hours he spent with me and how much love and care I gave him. Yes, even if I needed to go somewhere closeby, he went with me. And yes, I feel better.. but it will always hurt. And this time around with my rescued pittie Taz, I cannot avoid it. I need to do this myself - when his time may come. I dread it. But I owe it to Taz, as much as I owe it to Blitzy. Do not be so harsh on yourself, Fred. You loved her, she loved you.

So without knowing individual's background, it's impossible to judge whether s/he is a drug dealer or simply a victim of school <mw correct="bullying" type="delrep" mv="no">bulying</mw>.

What do you expect to happen in the meantime? We will ignore criminal activity just because a solution may be available a hundred years for now. I don't think so.

		<s sv="no">There are also solid, important reasons for taking a more subtle approach to the Judeao-Christian imagery, though the nature of the story means it could hardly be left out. It is fairly safe to assume that the number of people who actually believe in Odin or Thoth are fairly small, if they exist at all, so those characters are free to be reinterpreted without taking pot shots at people's deeply held beliefs. Most of the mythologies present here, I confess, I have very little knowledge of - I have a vague knowledge of Norse mythology and I know Egyptian mythology of course, but the mythology I know best is classical, which isn't here. I don't know how far current beliefs are reflected in some of the other characters, especially the Native American characters, but I sense that there is an emphasis on the older, more <mw correct="forgotten" type="sub" mv="no">forgetten</mw> gods, which fits the story anyway, since it is about gods who are old and neglected - modern religious figures are assumed to be living somewhere where they are worshipped, not in America.</s>

The A's then changed into special Memorial Day baseball caps before taking the field, and we were shown clips of the soldiers who had warn them in the field before sending them back for the game.

		<s sv="no">I agree that there are many self-published books that just are not good, hence the reason those authors self-published. However that is not to say that all self-pub books are inferior.

Publishers apparently aren't willing to take the risk representing a new author presents. You were first published in the days when this was not the case. Writers must write the best content with perfect grammar, spelling, voice and all else a good story requires, but getting published can still be amazingly difficult. So self-publishing is the way to go. Maybe then a traditional publisher will take notice.

I have a proposal for a self-help book, and I was signed on by a well respected agent ( I've heard that from several sources, and he works with a highly reputable agency.) We are very close to having the proposal ready for selling, and he says that he is excited by my ideas. The problem is, I question his level of enthusiasm. After he signed me on, it took him weeks to get in touch with me, and when we had our first talk as agent and client, he really only planned to speak on the phone for ten minutes.

		<s sv="no">266, you are the most honest woman in the world. I am going to make a suggestion which you can ignore, but it helped me. We bloggers can share experience. The sugar thing is behind all of our troubles. Try for one week to eliminate anything that has sugar or sugar syrups in it -- particularly high fructose. Eat everything but stay completely away from white flour and sugar stuff. Your craving for sweets will go away <mw correct="and" type="inshor" mv="no">anbd</mw> you can then find a pattern of eating that will not be driven by your pancreas trying to deal with sugar but by your own enjoyment and pleasure and relationship with food. Your will be driving instead of the sweets driving you. It took me until I was in my 50s to figure this out and I regained a 100 lb wait loss because I thought I could go back to cake and goodies.

		<s sv="no">One of the main themes of the novel is how people deal with infidelity. This is a theme shared with Someone at a Distance, and it is one which Whipple takes seriously and does well. In The Priory, responses to infidelity are dealt with together with parenting. Some characters are pretty much neglected. Others are stifled with care and love and attention. Others are stifled with material comforts by their parents, and as a result are profoundly unhappy. They are unable to do anything or be anyone because they, even in adulthood, are so <mw correct="dependent" type="subphon" mv="no">dependant</mw> on their parents. This theme was powerfully developed throughout the novel, but when it came to the ending, Dorothy Whipple pretty much ignores it.

		<s sv="no">It's a good thought-provoking blog. Most "rules" we encounter in life are really there to help us think of others. Think of the reason behind rules. The reason that you take 3 garments into the dressing room is that others may be waiting and it's not thoughtful to try on 15 outfits when others are waiting who may only have one outfit. Try 3 on and get out so that someone else can use the dressing room. If there's no line, then there's no need to follow the rule. There is nothing more annoying that people who believe that the rules do not apply to them. At Disney, where the crowds are huge, when you enter a theatre, you are supposed to move down to the end of the aisle. The reason is so that people don't have to climb over you and so every seat can be filled. This results in a better, more orderly and <mw correct="efficient" type="subphon" mv="no">effecient</mw> experience for everyone. There's nothing worse than a family who sits in the center, ignores the employee's pleas for them to move down (they actually act deaf), and in the process teach their children that they are more important than all other people in the theatre. The reason we follow rules and the reason we teach our children to follow rules is that it causes us to think of others before ourselves. Thus, there's really only one rule to follow--the Golden Rule.</s>

It has been speculated that I might take the syllabi from my old university classes and discuss with the Dean of English whether they might be re-evaluated to transfer in at a higher level (which I thought they had already, hence my assumption of graduation this December) in order to knock that total deficit down to a more <mw correct="manageable" type="del" mv="no">managable</mw> number for this and next semester. I have sent an e-mail to a professor imploring her to allow me entry into two of her classes THIS semester, as to not have 23 credit hours next semester. I could manage six, three credit hour courses in a semester, but eight is a bit unrealistic, even for me.</s>

The two classes I‚Äôm trying to add this semester are poetry classes, on reading and one writing. That is a step closer to making my MFA in Creative Writing a concentration in Poetry. I‚Äôll get to meet more professors and do some networking. I might have the opportunity to completely overhaul the advising system after airing my complaints, benefiting others to come through the system. It will give me many choices of papers to enter into the English Department Essay Contest in May. I‚Äôll have another chance to see my work in Coraddi this Fall.
